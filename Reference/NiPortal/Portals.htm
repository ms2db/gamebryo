<h1>Portals</h1>

<p>Portals (<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiPortal</span> objects)
are perhaps the most important part of the portals library. They
represent a way of seeing from a part of a scene graph "through"
a polygon to another part of a scene graph. This represents the
idea of seeing a room through a doorway or window. Any part of
the adjoining scene (called the "adjoiner") that cannot be seen
from the eye point through the polygonal portal will be culled
out. Note that portals are <em>not</em> bi-directional; that is,
they represent the ability to see through a door in one direction
only. Two portals are required to represent both directions of an
open doorway.</p>

<p>Portals may be used independently of the above room groups, as
they may be attached in any scene to represent the ability to see
a scene through a "hole" of some sort.</p>

<p>Note that the adjoiner relationship is not a parent-child
relationship. A portal is a child of the scene graph from which
the portal is seen, while the adjoiner (the "To" scene graph that
is seen through the portal) is not a child of the portal. The
portal-adjoiner relationship is an independent connection between
two unrelated <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAVObject</span>
objects in the scene, not unlike the light-affected object
relationship in Gamebryo.</p>

<p>In general, the adjoiner of a portal in a room should be
another room. If, for example, the adjoiner of a portal was set
to be a piece of room geometry rather than the room itself, then
only the piece of room geometry would appear on the other side of
the portal. Any portals leading out of the adjacent room would be
left undrawn until the camera entered that room. This is probably
not the desired effect. However, in rare cases this can be used
for strange effects, allowing one set of objects to appear when
viewed through a portal, switching to a completely different room
when the camera crosses through the doorway into the room.</p>

<p>A portal actually works by making the view frustum
smaller&mdash;when a portal is processed, the portal code
projects the portal polygon into screen space. It then computes a
screen-aligned bounding box for the portal polygon. This
screen-aligned bounding box is intersected with the current view
rectangle. If the new view rectangle does not have zero size,
then the adjoiner is processed, culled to the new, smaller view
frustum. If another portal is seen through the first portal, the
smaller view rectangle is once again made smaller by intersecting
it with the new portal. In this way, each new portal makes the
more distant part of the scene be culled to tighter and tighter
view rectangles. No matter how many portals are pushed, the
system will not slow down, as we do not push more and more
clipping planes&mdash;we simply make the four-sided view
rectangle smaller.</p>
