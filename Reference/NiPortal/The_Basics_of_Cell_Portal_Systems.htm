<h1>The Basics of Cell-Portal Systems</h1>

<p>The cell-portal visibility method is a system that allows
interior scenes to be drawn very efficiently by representing not
only the basic geometry of the interior scene, but also the
high-level structure, in terms of visibility. In an interior
scene, the objects we render are the rooms and their contents.
While we could simply turn on z-buffering and render every room
every frame, this would be wasteful in most cases. For example,
if the camera was located in a room and was looking at a wall
with no doorways, it is worthless to render all of the other
rooms in the scene&mdash;architecturally, there is no way to see
these rooms.</p>

<p>Cell-portal visibility systems are an example of the fact that
every bit of high-level knowledge that can be encoded into a
scene can allow for optimizations. Viewed as unstructured
geometry, a scene must be rendered in its entirety every frame.
Viewed as a hierarchical scene graph with culling spheres, the
parts of the scene outside of the limits of the screen can be
culled quickly. Add in information about the grouping of scene
geometry into cells, along with visibility connections between
these cells, and entire cells within the field of view, but not
visible through doorways can be culled.</p>

<p>The basic building blocks of a cell-portal (or room-portal)
system are the cells and the portals. A cell is the geometry that
represents a room and everything in it, along with references to
the doorways that lead out of that room. Portals represent these
doorways, specifically the shape and location of the doorways
(which tell us how much we can see out of the doorway from our
current position) and a reference to the room that is seen
through the doorway.</p>
