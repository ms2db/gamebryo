<h1>How Intersection Points are Calculated</h1>

<p>The text below explains how the predicted point of
 intersection is calculated for different combinations of two intersecting
 object types.  Note that, for the sake of performance, these calculations are
 sometimes approximations.</p>

<h2>Box vs. Box</h2>

<p>When a collision has been detected for box vs. box, 
 using the first moment of collision, the system calculates the intersection 
 point based on the midpoint of the segment connecting the closest points 
 of the boxes.</p>

<h2>Box vs. Capsule</h2>

<p>The intersection point in a box vs. capsule collision 
 is determined as the midpoint of the segment joining the closest points 
 between the two objects.</p>

<h2>Box vs. Sphere</h2>

<p>When a collision between box and sphere is detected, 
 the intersection point is found through a process involving backtracking 
 in time using the objects' velocities to find the first time of intersection. 
 From that first collision moment, the intersection point is calculated 
 by multiplying the unit collision vector and the radius of the sphere.</p>

<h2>Box vs. Triangle</h2>

<p>The intersection point of a triangle and box is the 
 midpoint of the segment joining the box center and triangle centroid.</p>

<h2>Capsule vs. Capsule</h2>

<p>Capsule vs. capsule intersection points are determined 
 similarly to the capsule vs. sphere (and therefore sphere vs. sphere) 
 combination because capsules can be treated as spheres swept along a line.</p>

<h2>Capsule vs. Sphere</h2>

<p>Capsule vs. sphere intersection points are determined 
 similarly to the sphere vs. sphere combination because capsules can be 
 treated as spheres swept along a line.</p>

<h2>Capsule vs. Triangle</h2>

<p>The intersection point between a capsule and triangle 
 is determined as the triangle origin when it first collides with the capsule.</p>

<h2>Sphere vs. Sphere</h2>

<p>When two spheres are found to intersect, the intersection 
 point is found through a process involving backtracking in time using 
 the objects' velocities to find the first time of intersection. Once this 
 time is found, the intersection point is the center of the slower sphere 
 plus the length of its radius multiplied by the unit normal collision 
 vector.</p>

<h2>Sphere vs. Triangle</h2>

<p>The intersection point is the spot where the shortest 
 distance segment from the sphere center to the triangle touches the triangle.</p>

<h2>Triangle vs. Triangle</h2>

<p>The intersection point of two triangles is returned 
 as the centroid of the smaller area triangle.</p>

<h2>Box vs. Halfspace</h2>

<p>The intersection point of a halfspace and box is the 
 box vertex that comes into contact with the halfspace plane first.</p>

<h2>Capsule vs. Halfspace</h2>

<p>The intersection point between halfspace and capsule 
 is calculated as the point on the capsule closest to the halfspace plane.</p>

<h2>Halfspace vs. Halfspace</h2>

<p>The intersection point of two halfspaces is the point 
 halfway between the regions defining overlap.</p>

<h2>Sphere vs. Halfspace</h2>

<p>The intersection point of a halfspace and sphere is 
 the point on the sphere closest to the halfspace plane.</p>

<h2>Triangle vs. Halfspace</h2>

<p>The intersection point between halfspace and triangle 
 is the triangle vertex that comes into contact with the halfspace plane 
 first.</p>
