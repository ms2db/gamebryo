<h1>Choice Of Strategy For Collision Detection</h1>

<p>Because indiscriminate use of collision detection can be an
 expensive operation in a real-time 3D application, you'll want to use the
 right approach for the right circumstances.</p>
 
<p>There's a saying, &quot;If all you have is a hammer, then
 every problem looks like a nail.&quot;  There may be circumstances when a
 fully general black-box collision system may be needed.  Alternatively,
 there may be cases where simpler alternatives work much better.  Often,
 combinations of approaches may be needed, to get the most out of each
 situation.</p>

<p>Regardless of the collision detection approaches you
 choose, you'll want to prototype and profile your use of them first, to make
 sure they meet your needs for performance, collision detection behavior,
 etc.</p>

<p>The accompanying sections cover different collision
 detection approaches in the context of the different situations for which
 each might be most applicable.</p>
