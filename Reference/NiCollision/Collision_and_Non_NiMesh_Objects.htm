<h1>Collision and Non-NiMesh Objects</h1>

<p>Objects in a scene graph that have no actual triangle-based 
 geometry in their hierarchy will have <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiBound.htm">NiBound</a></span>s 
 with zero radii and will therefore never return positive results in collision 
 detection. If non-<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh.htm">NiMesh</a></span> 
 objects are needed as part of a collision simulation, they either may 
 have an &quot;application-culled-for-rendering&quot; triangle-primitive 
 proxy mesh or may have an alternate bounding volume (ABV) for the object, 
 in which case the collision callback must take care of the desired behavior 
 for the application.</p>

<p>An example of this approach would be attaching ABVs 
 to the bones of a skinned character. Typically, an application wants collision 
 to affect the position of a character's bones, rather than the skin of 
 the character directly. The bones' ABVs efficiently serve this purpose 
 by acting as proxies for the collision system.</p>

<p>Of course, in some advanced cases it might be desirable 
 to have the skin of the character deform because of a collision. In those 
 situations, applications should be prepared for more expensive collision 
 operations that will likely require triangle-accurate collision detection.</p>
