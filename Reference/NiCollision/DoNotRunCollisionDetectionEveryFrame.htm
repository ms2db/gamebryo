<h1>Don't Run Collision Detection Every Frame</h1>

<p>This approach is one of the best ways to improve performance. 
 If your application is running at 100 fps, there will likely be no noticeable 
 difference in collision behavior if collisions are only run once every 
 10 frames.</p>

<p>Even better than tying collision calls to elapsed frames 
 would be to tie them to elapsed time. If the framerate changes, then collision 
 detection behavior will be consistent, with the added benefit that you 
 always know what time to pass in to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">FindCollisions</span> 
 call.</p>

<p>However, a superior approach is to amortize the cost 
 of collision detection over several frames. Perhaps different collision 
 groups can be handled in different frames, and a &quot;collision response&quot; 
 phase could reconcile all the results in a separate frame. By spreading 
 the cost over successive frames, you're better able to keep the frame 
 rate consistent, as well as minimizing the cost of collision detection 
 relative to other costs.</p>
