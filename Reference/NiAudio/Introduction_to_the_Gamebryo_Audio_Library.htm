<h1>Introduction to the Gamebryo Audio Library</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span> library is
designed as an abstraction between Gamebryo and any underlying
audio technology. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span>
provides a common interface for creating and manipulating sounds
in a cross-platform 3D environment. Being cross-platform poses
some unique challenges for Gamebryo, since there is currently no
cross-platform audio solution for all of the platforms that
Gamebryo supports. For this reason, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAudio</span> implements an abstract sound
interface that implements most common 3D audio features.</p>

<p>In the Gamebryo samples that utilize sound, a single function
implements the platform-specific sound initialization. When
developers need the special features of a particular sound
system, they are available by down-casting the current audio
system to the underlying platform-specific implementation. The
only implementation shipped with Gamebryo is the Miles Sound
System implementation. Customers wishing to use this
implementation must separately purchase a license for the Miles
Sound System directly from RAD Game Tools, Inc.</p>

<h2>Miles Audio System</h2>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiMilesAudioSystem.htm">NiMilesAudioSystem</a></span> is the
Miles-specific implementation of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"NiAudioSystem.htm">NiAudioSystem</a></span>.</p>

<p>The following sections describe the use of the Gamebryo Miles
audio library, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiMilesAudio</span>,
which is built using RAD Game Tools' Miles Sound System. Miles
provides 3D and non-spatialized native audio solutions through
underlying sound technologies, such as Creative Labs EAX,
DirectSound, and RSX 3D audio.</p>

<p>The Miles Sound System abstracts the underlying sound APIs and
provides a single high-level API that works with supported
lower-level APIs. Applications that use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMilesAudio</span> library, and thus the Miles
library, can support a number of audio filters with the same
code.</p>
