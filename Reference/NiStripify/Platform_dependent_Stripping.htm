<h1>Platform-dependent Stripping</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStripify</span> code chooses
a stripping algorithm based on an argument that indicates the
target platform. The most apparent difference between the
different algorithms concerns whether or not strips are stitched
together.</p>

<p>Because of the expense of stopping one strip and starting a
new strip during rendering on the Win32 and Xenon platforms, the
stripping algorithm used for those platforms stitches all strips
together into a single strip using degenerate triangles. This
stitching results in a stripped object having a higher triangle
count than the original unstripped object. The additional
triangles do not create a rendering overhead, however, since they
are quickly discarded by the rendering hardware.</p>

<p>The difference in the stripping algorithms used for each
platform is one of several factors that makes it inadvisable to
share NIF files across platforms when doing cross-platform
development. A separate NIF file should be exported for each
platform. The performance penalty for using a non-optimal
stripping algorithm for a given platform is significant. The
stitching that is done by the Win32 stripping code to prevent the
need to start a new strip increases the overall strip length, but
the cost of starting a new strip on Win32 is so severe that using
a non-stitching algorithm would likely result in performance that
is worse than it would be for an unstripped object.</p>

<p>The default stripification implementation is the one provided
