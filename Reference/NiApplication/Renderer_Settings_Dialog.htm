<h1>Renderer Settings Dialog</h1>

<p>The renderer settings dialog is set up and managed by the 
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiSettingsDialog/NiSettingsDialog_Introduction.htm">NiSettingsDialog</a></span> 
 library and is displayed when most <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiApplication</span>-based Gamebryo tutorials and demos are 
 launched. It allows the user to specify various settings such as resolution, 
 aspect ratio, vsync, etc. which will be used while the program is running.</p>

<p>The settings dialog has two modes; basic and advanced. 
 The user can switch between modes by pressing the "Advanced" 
 button. In basic mode, the only options presented are choice of renderer 
 (D3D 9, 10, or 11), resolution, aspect ratio, and full screen or windowed mode. 
 In advanced mode, all settings can be adjusted.</p>

<p>Once you press OK, the dialog will be closed and Gamebryo 
 will attempt to create a renderer with the chosen settings. If creation 
 fails, a warning will appear indicating that the selected settings were 
 not supported. The renderer settings dialog will then reappear, giving 
 the user another chance to pick settings that will work on their hardware. 
 Pressing Cancel will cause the application to exit and the 3D portion 
 of the program will not be run.</p>

<p>There are also a set of <a HREF="Renderer_options_from_the_Command_Line.htm">command 
 line options</a> that can be used to affect the initial settings in the 
 dialog box, or even whether it will appear at all.</p>

<p>Note that some settings may be disabled on systems which 
 do not support them.</p>

<h2>Save Settings</h2>

<p>If the checkbox is selected when the dialog is closed, 
 the application will save the settings to .INI file located next to the 
 executable. This allows preferred settings to be saved from one run of 
 the application to the next. To remove the default settings, simply delete 
 the .INI file and the original defaults will be reestablished.</p>

<h2>Basic View</h2>

<h3>Renderer</h3>

<p>This allows the user to select between the various D3D renderers. 
 The Direct3D 10 and Direct3D 11 options will only be displayed on systems which support 
 them - systems running Vista (or later) on D3D10- or D3D11-capable graphics hardware. 
 Systems running Vista (or later) without D3D10-capable hardware will not be presented with 
 the Direct3D 10 option unless the application is run with the -refrast 
 command line parameter, indicating that the reference rasterizer should 
 be used.</p>

<p>For some D3D renderers, an additional group of options may be displayed. 
These will give the user additional renderer-specific options to control.</p>

<h3>Resolution</h3>

<p>This allows the user to choose the horizontal and vertical 
 size in pixels of the area of the screen that the application will render 
 to. Only resolutions that are available on the current hardware will be 
 displayed.</p>

<h3>Full Screen</h3>

<p>Checking this box will cause the application to run 
 in full screen. Otherwise it will run in a window.</p>

<h3>Aspect ratio</h3>

<p>The aspect ratio settings can be used to limit the choices 
 of resolution to normal (4:3 / 5:4) or wide-screen (16:9 / 16:10) resolutions. 
 Selecting "Any" will show all available resolutions.</p>

<h3>Save settings</h3>

<p>If "Save settings" is checked, the choices made in the 
 renderer settings dialog will be saved to an INI file after successful 
 creation of a renderer. This means that the user will not have to re-select 
 the same settings again the next time the application is run.</p>

<h3>Do not show this dialog again</h3>

<p>If "Do not show this dialog again" is checked, the current 
 settings will be saved, and the dialog will not appear the next time the 
 application is started. Instead, the saved settings will be applied and 
 the 3D portion of the program will start immediately using the previous 
 settings. If the user wishes to make setting changes in the future, they 
 can run the application <a href="Renderer_options_from_the_Command_Line.htm">from 
 the command line</a> with the "-dlg" or "-dialog" switch, or <a href="Renderer_options_from_the_INI_file.htm">edit 
 the INI file. </a></p>

<p>If a renderer cannot be created using the saved settings 
 the dialog will always appear.</p>

<h3>Device Options</h3>

<p>This allows the user to choose between a hardware device 
 (HAL) or a software device (REF). In hardware mode, "Pure Device" 
 can be enabled which will force all vertex processing to use hardware. 
 This is the recommended option for the best performance.</p>

<p>The NVPerfHUD checkbox enables the use of NVPerfHUD 
 to profile the application and is only available if the application is 
 launched through NVPerfHUD. If this option is enabled, the ability to 
 select other device options and vertex processing mode will be not be 
 available.</p>

<h3>Vertex Processing</h3>

<p>Some applications still use software vertex processing, 
 and these options allow you to decide whether all vertex processing will 
 be done in software, all will be done in hardware, or if a mixture of 
 the two is used. Usually it is best to select hardware unless there is 
 a specific need for software vertex processing, such as shader debugging.</p>

<h3>Lock to vsync</h3>

<p>This will cause rendering to wait until the vertical 
 sync of the user's display to display the next frame of rendering. This 
 usually looks better because it eliminates horizontal tearing, but it 
 will limit your frame rate to the refresh rate of the monitor, so it is 
 useful to be able to turn it off during performance testing.</p>

<h3>Render Target Format</h3>

<p>This is the color format that the application will use. 
 X8R8G8B8 is 32-bit true color (8 bits per color with 8 unused), while 
 R5G6B5, or R5G5B5 are 16-bit high color (5 or 6 bits per color).</p>

<h3>Depth / Stencil Buffer Format</h3>

<p>This setting determines the resolution of the depth 
 and stencil buffer. The number after the D is the number of bits used 
 for depth, while the number after S is the number of bits used for the 
 stencil buffer. An X following the letter means that buffer is not used. 
 For example, D24S8 is a 24-bit depth buffer and an 8-bit stencil buffer, 
 while D24SX is a 24-bit depth buffer with no stencil buffer.</p>

<h3>MultiSampling</h3>

<p>This allows the user to choose the level and type of 
 anti-aliasing that will be used while the application is running. Enabling 
 this will enhance visual quality by reducing stair-step artifacts, especially 
 along the edges of polygons. Only modes which are supported by the current 
 hardware will be displayed.</p>
