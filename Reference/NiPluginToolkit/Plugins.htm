<h1>Plug-ins</h1>

<p>There are four main types of plug-ins:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Process Plug-ins&mdash;These plug-ins manipulate the data in
    the pipeline in some fashion. This manipulation may include
    such tasks as stripifying geometry, flattening out the scene
    graph hierarchy, creating collision bounding volumes, or
    adding new objects, for example. No output files are
    generated by process plug-ins.</li>

    <li>Import Plug-ins&mdash;These plug-ins open an existing file
    and bring its contents into the art pipeline. This import
    step may be as simple as loading a NIF file, or as
    complicated as opening a connection to a database and loading
    content.</li>

    <li>Export Plug-ins&mdash;These plug-ins take content existing in
    the scene graph and write it to a file or files. This export
    step could be as simple as writing out a NIF file, or as
    complicated as writing out the various sequences of keyframes
    in a KF file.</li>

    <li>Viewer Plug-ins&mdash;These plug-ins provide graphical
    feedback on information created by a scene graph. For
    instance, a viewer plug-in could be used for physics
    simulation or even a stripped-down version of the final
    game. Viewer plug-ins can also be used to launch a
    third-party application, providing the data from the
    pipeline.</li>
</ul>
