<h1>Introduction to Animation</h1>

<p>Gamebryo includes a powerful animation system that supports
automatic animation playback and character-driven animation
sequences with the ability to blend between multiple animations
simultaneously. Gamebryo supports animating nearly any parameter
that artists can animate in 3ds max and Maya and will export that
animation to automatically work in the engine. Artists can also
set up animation sequences that can be activated and blended
programmatically to achieve an array of visual results. This
documentation will describe the overall animation design
philosophy for Gamebryo along with how the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiAnimation</span> library classes work in the
engine.</p>

<p>The Gamebryo animation system was designed using a
controller/controlled-object philosophy. In this scheme,
animation controllers are given a target object to manipulate and
are placed on that object's list of controllers. During the
object's <span class="NDLSystemFont">Update</span> call, the
controller changes some aspect of the target object based on the
current time. As time passes, the attributes of the target object
change, which results in a time-based animation.</p>

<p>The following sections will give the reader a basic
introduction to the animation system. The topics listed under
Animation Basics describe the low level concepts and components
on which the animation system is built. Higher level concepts
such as sequence-based character animation and animation
compression are described in the sections under Higher Level
Animation Systems. Although it is beneficial to understand how
the underlying animation components work, many applications will
be able to operate using just these higher level systems for
animating characters.</p>
