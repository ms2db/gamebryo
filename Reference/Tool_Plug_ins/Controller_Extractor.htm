<p class="NDLRefHeadClassTitle">Controller Extractor</p>

<p class="NDLRefParentage">Type: EXPORT</p>

<p class="NDLRefParentage">Version: 2.6</p>

<p class="NDLRefHeaderFile">&lt;ControllerExtractor.dll&gt;</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead1">Description</p>

<p>This plug-in extracts <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpolator.htm">NiInterpolator</a></span> 
 objects attached to <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpController.htm">NiInterpController</a></span>s 
 in the scene graph, converts them to equivalent <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiEvaluator.htm">NiEvaluator</a></span> 
 objects using <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiInterpolatorConverter.htm">NiInterpolatorConverter</a></span>, 
 and saves the evaluators in <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiSequenceData.htm">NiSequenceData</a></span> 
 objects that reside in KF files.&nbsp;Animation sequences must be specified 
 in the art package for this plug-in to execute successfully.&nbsp;See 
 the <a HREF="../../Art/Max/Max_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">3ds 
 max</a> and Maya plug-in documentation for more information on specifying 
 animation sequences.</p>

<p>The plug-in relies heavily on the functionality provided 
 by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../NiControllerExtractor/Introduction_to_NiControllerExtractor.htm">NiControllerExtractor</a></span> 
 library.</p>

<p>See the <a HREF="../../RelNotes/All/Release_Notes__Tool_Plug_ins.htm#Controller_Extractor_Kown_Issues">Known 
 Issues and Limitations</a> for additional information.</p>

    <p class="NDLFigureCaption">Controller Extractor Options</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Sequences Per KF File</p>

<p>There are two ways of extracting sequences: all the 
 sequences can be extracted to a single KF file or each sequence can be 
 extracted to its own KF file. If each sequence is extracted to its own 
 KF file, the KF File Naming Convention options are available. Otherwise, 
 they are grayed out and the KF file has the same name as the NIF file.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">KF File Naming Convention</p>

<p>If each sequence is being extracted to its own KF file, 
 these options determine the naming convention for each of those KF files. 
 A preview of the KF file name is shown below these options. The exported 
 file name is the name of the NIF file for this character. The character 
 name is the name of the actor root node as specified in the art package. 
 The layer name will only be written out for layered sequences. There is 
 also the option to use an upper or lower case file extension.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Example File Name</p>

<p>This box shows a preview of the exported KF file name.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Compression</p>

<p>Sometimes, compressing animation keys in the sequence 
 can result in a larger file size, especially if the animation keys are 
 not easily fitted to a curve. This option will disable compression if 
 the compressed sequence will be larger.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">KFM File</p>

<p>You have the option of creating and saving out a KFM 
 file for the character that includes information about the extracted NIF 
 and KF files and sequences. Transitions are set up between every sequence 
 as they would be in the Gamebryo Animation Tool. Note that when a new 
 KFM file is created for the character, all the animation set-up work done 
 in <a HREF="../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation 
 Tool</a> is lost, and must be completely re-done. In general, a KFM file 
 should only be created once for a character.</p>

<p>KFM files support only one character. If you are exporting 
 from a file that contains more than one actor root, you have the option 
 here of appending the character name to the KFM file name so that exporting 
 KFM files for additional characters later will not overwrite the KFM file 
 for this character.</p>

<p>Checking the &quot;Create KFM File&quot; check box will 
 enable the &quot;Default Transition Settings&quot; section.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Default Transition Settings</p>

<p>When generating a KFM file upon export, transitions 
 are set up between every sequence. If morph tags are present for two animations, 
 a default synchronized transition is used. Otherwise, a default non-synchronized 
 transition is used. The default transition type and duration for these 
 synchronized and non-synchronized transitions can be set here.</p>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">Excluded Controllers</p>

<p>The Controller Extractor plug-in provides the option 
 to exclude certain types of controllers from being extracted and included 
 in sequences.</p>

<p>Checking the &quot;NiFlipController&quot; check box 
 will prevent any <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiFlipController.htm">NiFlipController</a></span> 
 objects from being included in any sequences. <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFlipController</span> 
 objects are used when performing flipbook texture animation using IFL 
 files. Often, the looping frequency of an IFL file is short and is intended 
 to loop indefinitely and not be synchronized to any particular sequence. 
 However, if its looping frequency is less than the particular sequence, 
 clamping may occur upon export. To avoid this, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiFlipController</span> 
 objects can be excluded from sequences, causing them to always be active 
 no matter which sequences are active.</p>

<p>Checking the &quot;NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr&quot; check box 
 causes any <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a HREF="../../NiParticle/NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr.htm">NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr</a></span> 
 objects to be removed from particle systems. These controllers cause particle 
 systems in sequences to loop independently of the sequence looping values, 
 which may be undesirable. This option is checked by default and is effective 
 when the <a HREF="KFM_Viewer.htm">KFM Viewer</a> tool plug-in is used 
 to preview animations. When looping of particle systems with reset on 
 each loop is required, set the looping period of the particle system to 
 match the sequence length for the sequence in which the particle system 
 is used, and do not check the &quot;NiPSResetOnLoopCtlr&quot; box.</p>

<p>A list of custom controller types can also be supplied 
 that will be excluded during sequence extraction. Checking the &quot;Custom 
 controller types&quot; check box will enable the text box, in which can 
 be entered a semicolon-delimited list of controller names that should 
 be excluded. An example string that excludes <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiAlphaController.htm">NiAlphaController</a></span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiTextureTransformController.htm">NiTextureTransformController</a></span> 
 objects would look like this: &quot;<span class="NDLSystemFont">NiAlphaController;NiTextureTransformController;</span>&quot;.</p>
