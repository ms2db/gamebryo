<h1>XML Mesh Profile Terminology</h1>

<p>Before delving into the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NiMeshProfileXMLParser</span> library's XML
syntax and layout specifications, it may be helpful to become
familiarized with a few terms relating to mesh objects that will
be frequently used within this documentation. These terms are
listed below.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Element</b>&mdash;An element is an array of data that
    is labeled by a <b>Semantic</b>, which is used to identify
    the element and indicate its purpose. Some examples of
    elements are vertex positions, vertex normals, and the vertex
    indices array.</li>

    <li><b>Stream</b>&mdash;A stream is a buffer of memory that
    contains interleaved arrays of one or more elements.</li>

    <li><b>Interleaving</b>&mdash;Interleaving is the process of
    combining multiple elements' data into a single stream. To do
    this, each entry in the final stream is made up of
    alternating entries from each of the input elements. For
    example, interleaving position and normal vertex data would
    result in a data stream with data stored like this: Position
    0, Normal 0, Position 1, Normal 1, Position 2, Normal 2,
    etc.</li>

    <li><b>Access flags</b>&mdash;The Access flags of a stream
    describe how that data stream can be read and written by the
    CPU and GPU. This determines how and where the stream can be
    stored in memory. For example, a data stream that does not
    need to be read or written by the CPU but can be read by the
    GPU does not need to be stored in system memory and can exist
    only in video memory.</li>

    <li><b>Mesh Modifiers</b>&mdash;A mesh modifier is something
    that gets attached to the mesh and performs some operation on
    the mesh's data. The two most common examples of mesh
    modifiers are skinning and morphing. When a skinning mesh
    modifier is attached to a mesh, the vertex positions and
    normals can be deformed by bones.</li>
</ul>
