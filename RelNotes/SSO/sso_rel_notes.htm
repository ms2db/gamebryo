<h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The <a href="../../Programmer/Entity_Replication/sso_replication_intro.htm">Replication</a>
    system is new in this release.</li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Programmer/Networking/sso_networking_intro.htm">Networking</a> system in
    this release is now suitable for use in games as well as tools.</li>

    <li>Several modifications have been made to the <a href=
    "../../Programmer/Networking/sso_networking_intro.htm">Networking</a> system, including the
    addition of the concept of Virtual Qualities of Service. See <a href=
    "../../Programmer/Networking/sso_networking_quality_of_service.htm">Quality of Service</a> for
    details.</li>

    <li>The protocol versions have changed. Applications that are compiled with LightSpeed 3.0 will
    not be able to connect to or communicate with LightSpeed 3.1. This means that games that are
    compiled with LightSpeed 3.0 will not be able to rapidly iterate using Toolbench from
    LightSpeed 3.1 until they have been updated and re-compiled.</li>
    
</ul><a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations" id="Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a>

<h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>

<h3>All Gamebryo LightSpeed Releases</h3>

<h4>Multiplayer Rapid Iteration</h4>

<ul>
    <li>In the Script Debugger, there is currently no way to select which process a breakpoint is
    set in. The first process to hit that line of Lua will cause all processes to pause. The NetID
    of the process that actually hit the breakpoint should print in the Toolbench Output View.
    Toggle on the Debug channel in the Output View UI and check the Details column for the process ID
    associated with the breakpoint notification.</li>

    <li>Any change to the default <span class="NDLSystemFont">QualityOfService</span> will prevent the 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">RapidIterationService</span> from 
    establishing a connection with the AssetController. Other qualities of service can be used
    at the same time as Rapid Iteration by Replication as long as the <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::INetLib</span>
    in use derives from <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::NetLib</span>
    and passes requests for <span class="NDLSystemFont">kQOS_TCP</span> to the base class.
    <a href="../../Learn/SSO/sso_pc_enet_reliable_udp_intro_pc.htm">PC enet Reliable
    UDP</a> has an example of how to correctly 
    forward requests for <span class="NDLSystemFont">kQOS_TCP</span> to 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">efd::NetLib</span> in 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">NetLibEnet::CreateTransport</span>.
    See <a href="../../Programmer/Networking/sso_networking_quality_of_service.htm">Quality of 
    Service</a> for information about creating a game specific QualityOfService and <a href=
    "../../Reference/QuickRef_Config/config_qckref.htm#ReplicationGroup">Replication Group 
    Configuration Options</a> for how to specify which Replication Group uses which 
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">QualityOfService</span>.
    </li>
    
    <li>Care should be taken to avoid setting the ChannelManager.Port configuration value to the
    port used by the AssetController (default:13215). When this happens, rapid iteration will
    behave erratically or may not work at all. Symptoms include: unaccounted for
    AssetController connections, misreported connections in Toolbench, inablity to reset one 
    or more game instances, and odd behavior when debugging Lua scripts. To resolve these
    issues, change the ChannelManager.Port configuration value for all application instances
    to a port not used by the AssetController.</li>
    
    <li>If you're running peers on hosts connected to a subnet different from the host running
    Toolbench, these peers may not fully reconnect if Toolbench is closed and then re-opened. 
    If you've restarted Toolbench and see unexplained behavior in these situations, close all 
    application instances and restart them.</li> 
    
    <li>The AssetController displays the number of active connections as a tooltip if you hover
    over its icon in the system tray. If the number of connections is reported as '-1', this
    indicates the AssetController was unable to bind to a listen port (default:13215). This 
    typically happens if there is another instance of the AssetController already running.
    You should resolve this conflict before attempting multiplayer rapid iteration.</li>
