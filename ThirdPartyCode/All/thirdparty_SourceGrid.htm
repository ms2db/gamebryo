<h1>Third Party Code - SourceGrid</h1>

<h2>Version</h2>
<p>2.2.0.0 <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/sourcegrid/ " target="_blank">http://www.codeplex.com/sourcegrid/ </a></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>SourceGrid is a Windows Forms grid control.</p>
 
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Gamebryo Animation Tool includes a .NET control 
 called SourceGrid that was originally developed by Davide Icardi. The 
 relevant files are in the Animation Tool directory as:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\Tools\AnimationTool\SourceGrid2\*</span></p>
    <p>Emergent Game Technologies believes that it is in full compliance with the terms 
        of the license for the portions of the engine that include and make use of this 
        code.</p>


<h2>License</h2>

<p>Change SourceGrid code</p>

<p>You are allowed to change, recompile and to distribute 
 the control SourceGrid for private and commercial use, I ask only to maintain 
 the Copyright notes at the end of the page.</p>

<p>I recommend changing the file SourceGrid2.snk with a 
 personalized version, so you do not have problems with compatibility with 
 different versions of the control. Consult MSDN for further information:
