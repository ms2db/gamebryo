<h1>Third Party Code - Flex</h1>

<h2>Version</h2>
<p>Flex 2.5.4a: <a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">http://flex.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Flex is a tool for generating scanners. A scanner, sometimes called a tokenizer, is a program which recognizes lexical patterns in text. The flex program reads user-specified input files, or its standard input if no file names are given, for a description of a scanner to generate. The description is in the form of pairs of regular expressions and C code, called rules. Flex generates a C source file named, "lex.yy.c", which defines the function yylex(). The file "lex.yy.c" can be compiled and linked to produce an executable. When the executable is run, it analyzes its input for occurrences of text matching the regular expressions for each rule. Whenever it finds a match, it executes the corresponding C code.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>One of the libraries in Gamebryo's NSF-based shader 
 system, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParser</span>, makes use of the Flex 
 and Bison libraries. Both of these libraries are open source, and customers 
 must understand and comply with the terms of the respective license agreements.</p>

<p>This should not be construed as legal advice in any 
 way; all licensing issues should be addressed by a qualified attorney. 
 That being said, the licensing issues for Gamebryo's use of Flex and Bison 
 should not be a concern for three reasons. First, the licenses themselves 
 are not overly restricting; second, the Flex and Bison libraries themselves 
 are not actually included in any Gamebryo library, but are instead used 
 to generate code that is used by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> 
 library; and third, it is not necessary (or even desirable) to ship an 
 application that directly incorporates the code that the Flex and Bison 
 libraries produce.</p>

<p>In any event, shipping applications have no need to 
 link to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> library at all. 
 The <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> library is used to parse 
 text-based shader description files, called NSF files, into binary shader 
 description files, called NSB files. A separate library, <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSBShaderLib</span>, 
 reads in the NSB files and generates shaders from them. While some Gamebryo 
 sample applications link to both <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> 
 and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSBShaderLib</span>, it is in no way required 
 for a shipping Gamebryo application to do so. In fact, to do so would 
 mean that the text-based NSF shader files would also need to be shipped 
 with the application. Instead, it is expected that shipping Gamebryo applications 
 will link only with the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSBShaderLib</span> library, 
 which reads the binary NSB files. Before shipping, an internal tool that 
 makes use of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> can create 
 the necessary NSB files from the NSF files. This way, no user-readable 
 files need to ship with the application, and no code that has been generated 
 by either Flex or Bison needs to be included in the final application.</p>

<p>If an application is distributed that includes the Flex 
 source or binary, the inclusion of the license text and the proper acknowledgement 
 should be sufficient for licensing terms. But as the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> 
 library itself does not include the Flex source or binary, Gamebryo applications 
 that link to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> library should 
 have no need to distribute Flex in any form.</p>
    <p>Emergent Game Technologies believes that it is in full compliance with the terms 
        of the license for the portions of the engine that include and make use of this 
        code.</p>
