<h1>Third Party Code - Atmospheric Scattering Shader Implementation</h1>

<h2>Version</h2>
<p>&quot;Accurate Atmospheric Scattering&quot;, Chapter 16 in <span class="NDLDocTitle">GPU Gems 2</span>, 
  Editor: Matt Pharr, Addison Wesley, &copy Copyright 2005.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This code is a shader implementation to approximate atmospheric scattering calculations.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Gamebryo atmospheric scattering code in <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NiEnvironment</span> files:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">
    <em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Source\CoreRuntime\EngineLibs\NiEnvironment\NiAtmosphereMaterialNodeLibrary\*</span></p>

<p>is based upon code by Sean O'Neil, from article &quot;Accurate Atmospheric Scattering&quot;, Chapter 16 in <span class="NDLDocTitle">GPU Gems 2</span>, March 2005. This code is governed by the following 
    license.</p>
