<h1>Third Party Code - Bison</h1>

<h2>Version</h2>

<p>Bison 2.1: <a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html" target=
"_blank">http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/bison.html</a></p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Bison is a general-purpose parser generator that converts an
annotated context-free grammar into an LALR(1) or GLR parser for
that grammar. Once you are proficient with Bison, you can use it
to develop a wide range of language parsers, from those used in
simple desk calculators to complex programming languages.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>One of the libraries in Gamebryo's NSF-based shader system,
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParser</span>, makes use of the
Flex and Bison libraries. Both of these libraries are open
source, and customers must understand and comply with the terms
of the respective license agreements.</p>

<p>This should not be construed as legal advice in any way; all
licensing issues should be addressed by a qualified attorney.
That being said, the licensing issues for Gamebryo's use of Flex
and Bison should not be a concern for three reasons. First, the
licenses themselves are not overly restricting; second, the Flex
and Bison libraries themselves are not actually included in any
Gamebryo library, but are instead used to generate code that is
used by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span>
library; and third, it is not necessary (or even desirable) to
ship an application that directly incorporates the code that the
Flex and Bison libraries produce.</p>

<p>Shipping applications have no need to link to the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> library at all. The
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> library is used
to parse text-based shader description files, called NSF files,
into binary shader description files, called NSB files. A
separate library, <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSBShaderLib</span>, reads in the NSB files and
generates shaders from them. While some Gamebryo sample
applications link to both <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> and <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSBShaderLib</span>, it is in no way required for
a shipping Gamebryo application to do so. In fact, to do so would
mean that the text-based NSF shader files would also need to be
shipped with the application. Instead, it is expected that
shipping Gamebryo applications will link only with the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">NSBShaderLib</span> library, which
reads the binary NSB files. Before shipping, an internal tool
that makes use of the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span> can create the necessary NSB
files from the NSF files. This way, no user-readable files need
to ship with the application, and no code that has been generated
by either Flex or Bison needs to be included in the final
application.</p>

<p>Emergent Game Technologies believes that it is in full
compliance with the terms of the license for the portions of the
engine that include and make use of this code.</p>

<h2>License</h2>

<p>Bison is distributed under the more stringent GPL (<a href=
"http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_mono/bison.html#Copying"
target=
"_blank">http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_mono/bison.html#Copying</a>).
Therefore, an application would normally need to abide by the
terms of that license in order to distribute software that
includes any original or modified Bison source code. In the case
of Bison, which generates a source code file (that inherently
includes some Bison source code), a special exception has been
granted for applications that use that source code file:</p>

<p class="indent1">As of Bison version 1.24, we have changed the
distribution terms for yyparse to permit using Bison's output in
nonfree programs when Bison is generating C code for LALR(1)
parsers.</p>

<p>The version of Bison used with Gamebryo is later than version
1.24, and is consistent with the terms specified here. In
addition, all files generated by Bison that Gamebryo makes use of
include this text in a comment at the beginning of the file:</p>

<p class="indent1">As a special exception, when this file is
copied by Bison into a Bison output file, you may use that output
file without restriction. This special exception was added by the
Free Software Foundation in version 1.24 of Bison.</p>

<p>The code that Bison generates should therefore be free to be
used by the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSFParserLib</span>
library without licensing repercussions.</p>
