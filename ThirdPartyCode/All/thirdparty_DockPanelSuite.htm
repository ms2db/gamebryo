<h1>Third Party Code - DockPanel Suite</h1>
<h2>Version</h2>
<p>DockPanel Suite 2.2.0.0: 
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite" target="_blank">http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite</a>.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The docking library for .Net Windows Forms development which mimics Visual Studio .Net developed by Weifen Luo.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>This control is used in Emergent's Animation Tool and Toolbench applications.
 They are used to add &quot;docking&quot; 
 behavior to some controls (the ability to float or link a tray of controls 
 to other controls in an interface).</p>

<p>Toolbench uses a slightly modified version of the DockPanel source, which can be found under
 Source/Tools/Toolbench/WeifenLuo.DockPanel.
 The modifications are to support the UI styles applied in Toolbench.</p>

<p>Emergent Game Technologies believes that it is in full compliance with the terms 
 of the license for the portions of the engine that include and make use of this 
 code.</p>
