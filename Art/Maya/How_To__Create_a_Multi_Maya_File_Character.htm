<h1>Creating a Multiple Maya File Character</h1>


<p>A multiple Maya file character has its animations spread 
 across a number of Maya files. This is necessary if you need to have multiple 
 artists working simultaneously on the same character or if the animation 
 data is large enough that Maya doesn't perform well. The only major drawback 
 to multiple Maya file characters is organization. You need to be careful 
 how you organize your files, and exporting the character has some manual 
 steps.</p>

<h4>1. Create a base idle sequence Maya file</h4>


<p>The Gamebryo Actor Manager needs three different files: 
 a NIF file containing the character's geometry and textures, a set of 
 KF files containing the animation data, and a KFM file to define sequence 
 transitions. When you export a single Maya file character, these three 
 pieces are made for you automatically. With a multiple Maya file character, 
 exporting the base idle sequence will be what creates the NIF and KFM 
 files. To create the base Idle animation you just follow steps 2 through 
 7. When you create the animation (step4) you need to animate everything 
 that will be animated in ANY other source.</p>

<h4>2. Create a new Maya file for this sequence.</h4>


<p>Create a new Maya file and add the rigged base character. 
 You could just import the rigged character but you must be very careful. 
 The scene graph and object names MUST match between all sequences. We 
 recommend adding the rigged character via a file reference so any changes 
 in the base character will be automatically updated in all the sequences.</p>

<h4>3. Start in the Bind Pose</h4>

<p>As a rule of thumb it is best to start the character 
 off at frame zero in the bind pose. To properly export the relationship 
 between skin and bones, it is necessary to get the skeleton back into 
 its bind pose. As you are using Maya, it is possible to alter the scene 
 graph so the skeleton can no longer get back to its bind pose. By starting 
 the character in the bind pose, you may circumvent some of these problems.</p>

<h4>4. Create a Sequence</h4>


<p>Start by selecting the Accumulation Root. In the Sequence Window, click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Create Sequence</span> button and set your sequence name, start frame, and end frame. It is important 
 to remember that every sequence name must be unique. The programmers will 
 be using the sequence name when they activate animations in the game. 
 If this is your first sequence, you will also want to set the Character Root. 
 Just select your character root node in Maya and click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Set to Selected</span> button.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of sequences> full body and layer. 
 A layer sequence only affects part of the character and can be played 
 on top of other sequences. When you look at the DestroyerBot example, 
 there are full body animations for walking and running, but there are 
 also layer sequences for firing lasers, missiles, and flares. Gamebryo's 
 Actor Manager allows you to play both animations simultaneously. This 
 will reduce the number of animations you need to produce and adds flexibility. 
 Creating a Layer Sequence is just like creating a full body one except 
 that you select a different root node in Maya before you click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Create 
 Character Sequence</span> button. In the DestroyerBot example, the layer 
 sequences are on the | DestroyerBot | Accumulation_Root | Hips | Body 
 node. It is important to remember that only the Layer Root and all of its 
 children will be part of the Layer Sequence.</p>

<h4>5. Create an Animation</h4>

<p>Creating your character animations is fairly straight 
 forward using either key frame animation or IK animation. Since your character 
 is in its bind pose at frame zero, you need to pick a range of frames 
 to hold your animation. For example, the DestroyerBot's walk animation 
 goes from frame 336 to 384. There are a couple of things to consider:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Only animate the attributes 
 you will be changing. It seems obvious, but it is worth mentioning that 
 the fastest animated attributes are the ones that aren't animated.</li>
	
	<li>
	<p>IK Solver Stability: By default Gamebryo samples rotation with quaternions, which prevents flipping. However, if euler 
 angles are used instead, the animation should be prebaked inside Maya 
 and after which the artist should apply an euler filter to the rotation 
 curves. The explanation that follows only applies if quaternion sampling 
 is turned off.</p>
	
	<p>Since Gamebryo only supports key frame animation, 
 it is necessary for the exporter to automatically &quot;bake&quot; your 
 animation. Between two consecutive frames, it is possible for an IK solver 
 to choose a radically different solution. For example, it might use a 
 180 degree X rotation one frame and then use a -180 degree X rotation 
 the next. These rapid transitions happen between frames in Maya, but they 
 can appear as a flash in Gamebryo. Setting joint limits should help alleviate 
 the problem but may not completely eliminate it.</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>Keep at least one frame 
 between the end of one sequence and the beginning of the next. Most of 
 the time, the ending position of one sequence isn't the beginning position 
 of the next. If you leave one frame, then it will give you time to get 
 from one pose to the next. Once your animations are created, you can fix 
 this problem, but it is annoying and easy to avoid in the first place.</li>
	
	<li>Create a key for everything 
 animated on your character at the beginning and at the end of your sequence. 
 This will prevent the changes you make in this sequence from affecting 
 other sequences.</li>
</ul>

<h4>6. Set Character Compression Options (Optional)</h4>


<p>The Gamebryo Maya exporter can attempt to automatically 
 reduce the size of your animation data using B-spline curve fitting and 
 the use of compact keys. Just select the Accumulation Root and click the 
 Character Animation Compression button.

<h4>7. Build Remaining Sequences</h4>

<p>Just keep repeating steps 2 through 7 until you have 
 created all of your sequences.</p>

<h4>8. Export the Character</h4>

<p>Exporting a multi-file character is a little more involved 
 than a single file character. To completely export the character, just 
 follow the following steps. One benefit of the multiple file character 
 is streamlining partial export; if you just changed a sequence, you only 
 need to re-export that sequence rather than all of them.</p>

<ol>
	
	<li>Export the base idle 
 sequence. You can use a script like &quot;Default Multi-File Base Character 
 Export (NIF and KFM)&quot;, which will generate your character's NIF and 
 KFM files.</li>
	
	<li>Export each sequence 
 file using a script like &quot;Default Multi-File Character Export (KF 
 only)&quot;. This script will export just the KF files.</li>
</ol>

<h4>9. Tweak Sequence Transitions in the Animation Tool</h4>


<p>The Gamebryo Animation Tool is designed to augment the art pipeline by providing a feature-rich tool for organizing and manipulating the animations of 
 a game character.</p>
