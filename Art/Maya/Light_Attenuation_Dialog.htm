<h1>Light Attenuation Dialog</h1>

<p>The light attenuation dialog is a custom interface to 
 make setting the attenuation values of lights easy.  With this dialog, 
 you can specify the use of Maya's decay rate or a decay rate through Gamebryo.  
 When specifying the attenuation through distance, it is important to remember 
 that light intensity drops away rapidly, but never actually reaches zero.  
 Through the interface, you specify a "Max Distance", but in 
 reality, this distance is only where the light is 1% of its original intensity.  
 The table below, "Light Distance By Intensity", shows distances 
 and intensities so you can see the general shape of the curve.  There 
 is a great deal of difference between "Linear", and "Quadratic" 
 decay rates, so experimentation can be very useful.

attenuation. Setting maximum distance will automatically calculate the
attenuation over distance.</td>

the decay rate. This helps the custom window determine your attenuation
settings. You can choose between Linear and Quadratic. This field is
