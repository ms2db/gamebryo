<h1>Key Frame Reduction in Maya</h1>

<p>The key frame reduction window is designed to automate 
 the time consuming task of reducing character animation data. When characters 
 are animated using IK controllers, you must &quot;bake&quot; the animation 
 to convert it to key frame animations. During the baking process, an enormous 
 number of unnecessary keys are created. Key frame reduction is necessary 
 to control the size of animations by removing unnecessary animation keys. 
 Unfortunately, key frame reduction can introduce compounding numerical 
 error when the start or end keys of character sequences are reduced. You 
 might see this where a character will slowly sink into the ground the 
 farther the character runs or perhaps a slight rotation is applied every time the character moves. To solve this problem, the key frame reduction window 
 will avoid removing keys at the beginning and end of a sequence. The first 
 object selected in Maya will be used to determine what character sequences 
 you will use. Internally the key frame reduction is done using Maya's 
 &quot;Simplify&quot; command.</p>
