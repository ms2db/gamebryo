<h1>Animation Sequence Editor</h1>

<p>Animation Sequences are a powerful tool for creating
compelling interactive media. By utilizing a higher-level unified
concept of a character, Gamebryo can help you organize your art
to make it easy to use and create. Character sequences allow
animation accumulation that simplifies the creation of walk and
run cycles.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/MyImmerseSequenceIcon.png" width="32"
    height="32" alt="MyImmerseSequenceIcon (1K)"> 
    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
</div>

<p>In one export, all of the sequences for a character will be
saved. The Gamebryo Maya Plug-in supports exporting of Layered
Sequences as well as multiple characters per Maya file. For
convenience, the sequences are ordered by starting frame. The
exporter uses character sequences to find the characters in the
scene and differentiate between a character and any other object
in the scene.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The attribute Ni_CharacterRoot is used to tag an object
    as a Character Root.</li>

    <li>The attribute Ni_Sequence_Animation_Accumulation is used
    to tag an object as a Accumulation Root.</li>

    <li>There is not a specific attribute for layer roots. All
    dag nodes with sequences are by default layer roots.</li>

    <li>Sequences are stored in the compound multi attribute
    Ni_Sequence with children Ni_Sequence_Valid,
    Ni_Sequence_Name, Ni_Sequence_Start_Time,
    Ni_Sequence_End_Time, Ni_Sequence_Looping, Ni_Sequence_Rot,
    Ni_Sequence_Tran_X, Ni_Sequence_Tran_Y, and
    Ni_Sequence_Tran_Z. (The sequences section will be grayed out
    if there are no Character Roots in the scene.)</li>

    <li>Morph Tags are stored in the compound multi attribute
    Ni_MorphTag with children Ni_MorphTag_Valid, Ni_MorphTag_Name
    and Ni_MorphTag_Time. (The Morph Tags section will be grayed
    out if there are no Sequences for the current Layer
    Root.)</li>

    <li>Text Keys are stored in the compound multi attribute
    Ni_TextKey with children Ni_TextKey_Valid, Ni_TextKey_Name
    and Ni_TextKey_Time. (The Text Keys section will be grayed
    out if there are no Sequences for the current Layer
    Root.)</li>
</ul>
