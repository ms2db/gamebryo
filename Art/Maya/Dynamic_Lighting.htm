<h1>Dynamic Lighting with Maya</h1>

<p>Often, the easiest way to set up lighting is with standard 
 lights in Maya, but dynamic lights are expensive, and their use is overkill 
 in terms of performance if the light is not moving.&nbsp; If you need 
 a light to move around the scene, then you should use dynamic lights. 
 If the shader for the object is computing per-vertex lighting, the lighting 
 effects are only computed at the vertices of an object so the face count 
 or tessellation will usually have to be high to achieve a satisfying effect 
 with such a shader and a dynamic light.&nbsp;Shaders that use per-pixel 
 illumination must compute lighting for every visible pixel of the object, 
 and are typically even more sensitive to the number of dynamic lights 
 because you have almost no choice in how large an object must appear on 
 screen. Regardless, dynamic lighting should be used judiciously and with 
 as few lights as possible so your application can run at the highest speed.</p>
