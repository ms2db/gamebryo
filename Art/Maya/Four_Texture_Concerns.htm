<h1>Four Texture Concerns</h1>

<p>There are four issues you must keep in mind when adding 
 textures to a Maya scene:&nbsp; the texture's dimensions, its aspect ratio, 
 the effect of filtering, and its size in VRAM.&nbsp; VRAM is the memory 
 that is actually on the graphics card and can be accessed quickly by the 
 rendering hardware.&nbsp; The framebuffer (the part of VRAM used to draw 
 and display the screen) and the Z-buffer both occupy some portion of VRAM 
 and, thus, reduce the amount of memory available for textures.</p>

<h4>Cropping/resizing for the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in</h4>

<p>The first texturing issue is that Gamebryo limits a 
 texture to having each of its dimensions be a power of two.&nbsp; The 
 Gamebryo Maya Plug-in will give an error message in the Output Window 
 if any of the texture's dimensions are not a power of two, and the texture 
 will be resized to fit a power of two. </p>

<h4>Aspect Ratios for the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in</h4>

<p>Second, textures in Gamebryo do not need to be square, 
 but extreme aspect ratios will fragment VRAM.&nbsp; This behavior results 
 because odd-shaped textures are not as easy to pack together as regularly 
 shaped ones.&nbsp; In general, you should only use aspect ratios of less 
 than 8:1. Additionally, you should settle on a base set of texture sizes.&nbsp; 
 Textures with the same dimensions are easily interchanged in VRAM&mdash;allowing 
 for quicker VRAM management schemes.&nbsp; Having a lot of textures with 
 widely varying sizes will defeat this replacement-based texture management.</p>

<h4>Filtering for the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in </h4>

<p>The third texturing issue is that filtering (also known 
 as &quot;mipmapping&quot; or &quot;trilinear interpolation&quot; in Gamebryo) 
 increases the original VRAM size of a texture 1.33 times.&nbsp; When mipmapping 
 is enabled, all textures must be stored along with their filter levels, 
 where each level is a quarter the size of the prior level.&nbsp; Mipmapping 
 will improve texture aliasing, but it comes at the cost of some space 
 in VRAM.&nbsp; In other words, mipmapping improves visual quality in the 
 scene and should be used, in general, depending on the platform.&nbsp;A 
 default global filter can be set at export and overridden on individual 
 NiMultiShader Materials.&nbsp; For a detailed discussion of Filtering 
 in the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in, please see the section on Gamebryo Maya 
 Plug-in_Export_Filtering_Options.<span style="display: none;">*MyImmerse_Export_Filtering_Options</span></p>

<h4>Formats for the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in</h4>

<p>Finally, for a given texture, the amount of VRAM it 
 occupies is determined by its size and format. This information is important 
 because ultimately it determines how many textures can be used in a scene.&nbsp; 
 You can use palletized BMP files, compressed files like .DDS, or uncompressed 
 .TGA files.</p>

<p>It is possible to have more textures than will fit in 
 VRAM.&nbsp; In this case, the graphics card will fetch the texture from 
 system memory whenever it is needed for rendering.&nbsp; This process 
 is much slower than getting a texture from VRAM and should be completely 
 avoided on PCI graphics cards.&nbsp; It is not necessary to completely 
 avoid overflowing VRAM on AGP graphics cards, but performance will still 
 degrade, as more textures have to be retrieved from system memory.&nbsp; 
 Other than avoiding it entirely (by fitting all textures into VRAM), there 
 is little you can do to improve the fetching of textures from system memory.</p>
