<h1>Character Animation Compression with Maya</h1>

<p>During export, the Gamebryo Maya exporter can attempt 
 to compress character animations. This is particularly useful for baking 
 animations, IK animations which are automatically baked during export, 
 and motion captured animations. To use the character animation compression interface, select any part of the character scene graph under the character root node and click the compression icon on the Gamebryo shelf.</p>

<p>The character animation compression (CAC) interface 
 allows you to set a global level of compression and then customize the 
 compression by sequence or by transform. For example, if the &quot;Walk&quot; 
 is giving you problems, then you can increase the quality of the compression 
 for just that sequence. Alternatively, if the compression artifacts in 
 the &quot;Hips&quot; are making the feet skate in all of your animations, you can increase the quality of just that transform. By editing the compression 
 table directly you can override the compression for a specific transform 
 during a specific sequence.</p>

<p>The CAC interface also allows you to specify compact 
 keys. Compact keys store their values at half precision and therefore 
 take half the space in memory. Visually it is almost impossible to notice 
 the difference between full precision and half precision. Full precision 
 will allow you to specify a rotation no smaller then 0.00002 degrees. 
 Half precision will let you specify a rotation no smaller then 0.005 degrees. 
 Usually, the difference is not apparent.</p>

<p>Character animation compression differs from key frame reduction. Character animation compression is done on the original Maya animations at export. It preserves the original animations in Maya. On the other hand, key frame reduction (KFR) uses Maya's key frame reduction to alter the original animations in Maya. The KFR interface was intended to be used as a finalization step for your assets once you are completely satisfied. Unfortunately, the KFR is destructive, so changing the finalized assets can be difficult because you need to redo the tedious process of reduction. CAC allows you to preserve your animation by compressing during export, and it streamlines the process of tweaking compression values.</p>
