<h1>Maya Particle System Tips and Tricks</h1>

<h2>Lighting</h2>

<p>A common problem with particles is that they are affected by
lighting if using the default settings for the Gamebryo
NiMultiShader. This means that when there aren't any lights in
the scene, the particles will appear black.</p>

<p>When it comes to particles, it is very uncommon to actually
want them to be affected by lighting since changing the camera
angle will result in all of the particles uniformly darkening or
lightening, which looks very unnatural.</p>

<p>To avoid this situation, set the NiMultiShader attributes as
follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Material Emittance</span> = White</li>
  <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Material Diffuse</span> = Black</li>
  <li>Vertex Colors
    <ul>
      <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Source Mode</span> = Emissive</li>
      <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Light Mode</span> = Emissive Only</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Using an emissive color will multiply the color of the
particle just like setting a diffuse color would; the main
difference is that the diffuse color is also multiplied by the
result of the lighting, which will look odd since sprite
particles are often facing the camera.</p>
<h2>Particle Glow Effect</h2>
<p>Alpha Blending settings can be used to create a particle glow
effect. To use additive blending, set the NiMultiShader
attributes as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpha Transparency
    <ul>
		  <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Override Default Values</span> = On</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Alpha Blending
	<ul>
    <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Use Alpha Blending</span> = On</li>
    <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Source</span> = One</li>
    <li><span class="NDLGUILabel">Destination</span> = One</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Particle Systems that Overlap and Swap</h2>
<p>If there are two particle systems that are close together,
which are constantly swapping between which draws on top, this is
most likely because the two systems' dynamic bounds are causing
    the bounding volume&#39;s centroid to change over time. By default, Gamebryo uses 
    the centroid of the bounding sphere to determine sort order.</p>

<p>This problem can be corrected by using the
<span class="NDLGUILabel">Bounds Type</span> setting on the <a href="rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm">NiParticleSystem</a>. Using the
static option allows the artist to specify the bounding
sphere&#8217;s location and radius, and thus, control the
particle system&#39;s centroid. If the
    particle systems&#39; centroids are the same, then the particles will be drawn
in the order in which they appear in the scene. This can set by
ordering the <a href="rpi_niparticlesystem_node_reference.htm">NiParticleSystem</a>
nodes in the Maya Outliner tree view.</p>
<h2>How to Hide the Mesh used in Mesh and Surface Emitters</h2>
<p>It is often the case that when a mesh is used as a particle,
the original needs to be hidden or else it is rendered somewhere
in the scene. Likewise, it is sometimes desirable to hide a mesh
that is being used as a surface emitter. In both of these
situations, the mesh should be hidden by selecting the
transform node of the mesh in Maya and setting the
<span class="NDLGUILabel">Visibility</span> attribute to disabled.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tr align="left">
        <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
            <div class="NDLNote">
Setting the Visibility to disabled for the
mesh&#8217;s shape node will result in the particles being
hidden for a surface emitter. In addition, hiding the mesh
particle&#8217;s shape node will convert a mesh particle
system to a sprite particle system. Always hide the transform
node of the mesh.
