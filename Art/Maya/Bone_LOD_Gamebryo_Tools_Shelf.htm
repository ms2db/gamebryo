<p>Bone LOD is a special feature of the Gamebryo animation system that enables you to optimize skinned characters. The Bone LOD system allows you to select the different bones of a character and mark them for a particular level of detail. The focus of the system is to allow you to automatically generate simpler skeletons to use at lower levels of detail. For example you would create a highly detailed skeleton with individual fingers and numerous bones for facial animation during close up camera shots. For close up shots you would want to use the highest level of detail but during regular game play you would want to use a lower level of detail.</p>

<p>Special considerations for using Bone LOD include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bone LOD Levels start at ZERO&mdash;It is very important to remember that Bone LOD levels 
 start at Zero (0) as the highest level of detail. This may seem backwards 
 because Level 0 is the highest level of detail but this was done for performance 
 reasons so please keep the level numbering system in mind</li>
	<li>The character skin MUST have a Skin LOD set&mdash;For Bone LOD to work properly the skin associated with 
 these bones must have the Skin LOD set. See below how to setup the Skin 
 LOD.</li>
</ul>

<p>To add Bone LOD select the bone root of the character 
 and click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Setup/Edit Bone LOD</span> icon. This will create the Gamebryo Bone LOD window and open the Hypergraph so you can properly view the different levels.</p>

			<td>Select level</td>
			<td>Select all objects at the current level. This command is handy 
 for visualizing the different Bone LOD levels. You will need to view the 
 Hypergraph window to correctly see the selected objects. By default all 
 leaf objects are considered to be level 0.</td>
