<h1>Export Texture Options</h1>

<p>You can use the Export Texture Options dialog box to specify exported texture options such as resolution, save location, and texture formats.</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Use this field...</th>
			<th>To...</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>X Texture Resolution and Y Texture Resolution</td>

			<td>Define a default size for Maya to generate its procedural textures for the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in. The Gamebryo Maya Plug-in does not support procedural textures. It instead takes textures created by Maya and exports them in a NIF format, included or not included in the main file based on the Save Location.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Max X Texture Resolution and Max Y Texture Resolution</td>

			<td>Define the maximum size of any Maya procedural texture 
 exported by the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Save texture name as extra data</td>

			<td>Save the texture file name as <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStringExtraData</span> to each map in a texture. This is a useful option because when you save a texture internal to the NIF file, its original filename is lost. Many programmers would still like to use this information. For example, the difference between steel doors and wood doors might just be the name of the texture file name. Select this option to preserve this texture file name information as extra data.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Save Location</td>

			<td>Specify how you want to save textures that are associated with the exported NIF file. There are three different ways of saving the textures 
 associated with the exported NIF file: they can be saved internal to the 
 NIF file, they can be saved individually as their own NIF files, or they can be referenced in the original texture format.

 <div class="NDLTDNote"><span class="NDLTableNote">Note:</span> The 
 &quot;External Original&quot; option is only available when the export 
 option &quot;Flip Textures instead of UV Coordinates&quot; is un-checked. 
 During the load of textures, Maya flips all of its textures. To make Gamebryo 
 and Maya visually equivalent you need to flip the textures or the generated 
 UV coordinates. Since this texture flipping is done at export time, you 
 cannot leave the textures as external in their original format.</div>
 			</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
		    <td>Copy external textures to export path</td>
		    
		    <td>If the Save Location option for textures is set to External Original, this option controls whether the textures are copied to the export path.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Use default value for Ambient color in a Texture Material</td>

			<td>Use the default (black) ambient color. By simply using the default value in Maya, it is easy to create a scene with all black textures. When illuminated in the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in with only an ambient light, the object will appear black.&nbsp;The &quot;Ambient Color&quot; of a textured material 
 will be set in the &quot;Diffuse Color&quot; if and only if the &quot;Ambient 
 Color&quot; attribute is RGB (0,0,0).</td>
 		
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Default Texture Format</td>

			<td>Convert texture formats udring export. You can use this option to convert the texture format from the original format found in the file to another format. This allows you to keep your original art in a large high fidelity format and then convert to a format better suited for the destination platform.
 <div class="NDLTDNote"><span class="NDLTableNote">Note:</span> It 
 is important to remember this is only a preferred format. Not all formats 
 are supported on all platforms. During the export process the destination 
 renderer will determine the final destination format.</div>
 			</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Reduce Texture Size</td>

			<td>Specify an amount by which you want to reduce the size of exported textures. You can override the value that you enter here by using platform 
 texture properties.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>&lt;Platform&gt; Directory</td>

			<td>Create a platform- specific subdirectory where external textures will be placed. This directory will be created as a subdirectory of the destination directory for the NIF.</td>
 		</tr>
	</tbody>
