<h1>Exporting PhysX Content from Maya</h1>

<p>When a scene is exported using Gamebryo's exporter, PhysX
content associated with a Gamebryo node is added as extra data.
For example, any object with a rigid body transform node in Maya
has extra data in its Gamebryo node stating what type of actor it
is, what its PhysX properties are, and what its collision shape
is.</p>

<p>To convert this extra data into PhysX objects, such as actors,
joints and fluids, the scene graph must be processed by the PhysX
Extractor tool plug-in. The result can then be saved using any of
the standard NIF output plug-ins.</p>

<p>The PhysX Extractor tool plug-in creates a PhysX prop and a
Gamebryo interface for that prop. Properties such as hardware
support for the prop can be set via the options dialog for the
tool plug-in. The options also control the conversion of particle
systems into PhysX-based particle systems or fluids.</p>

<h4>Coordinate Systems</h4>

<p>The PhysX prop that is created by the PhysX Extractor is in
the same coordinate system as the scene root of the exported
Gamebryo scene graph. At run-time, when the prop is introduced
into Gamebryo, the transformation of the PhysX prop should be set
to match the global transformation of the scene graph in the
application.</p>

<h4>Additional Tool Plug-ins</h4>

<p>There are three other Tool Plug-ins associated with PhysX
content:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <em>PhysX Cleaner tool plug-in</em> removes the extra
    data encoding PhysX content from nodes. Use it if your Maya
    scene contains PhysX-enabled objects and you do not want that
    exported using Gamebryo's exporter. This plug-in is not
    required if the PhysX Extractor is in use because the latter
    removes the extra data as it processes it.</li>

    <li>The <em>PhysX Rag-doll tool plug-in</em> is used to
    associate a set of rigid bodies defining a rag-doll with a
    set of bones for the character the rag-doll will control. See
    the Creating Rag-dolls documentation for details on using
    this plug-in and setting up rag-dolls.</li>

    <li>The <em>PhysX Viewer tool plug-in</em> launches the PhysX
    NIF Viewer application which is the tool provided for
    previewing Gamebryo-PhysX content. Select the "Default PhysX
    Viewer Script" as the Custom Viewer in the Export Options to
    use this viewer. To launch the PhysX Nif Viewer on consoles,
    use the console-specific on-target viewer options.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Notes</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Platform Specific Export&mdash;PhysX targets the same
    platform for mesh cooking as the renderer is targeting.</li>

    <li>Changing the Up Direction in PhysX Nif Viewer&mdash;The
    default camera in PhysX NIF Viewer uses the gravity direction
    to determine up, or if gravity is not specified it uses the
    camera down direction. The gravity direction may be set from
    the PhysX Viewer tool plug-in options, accessible from the
    Script Editor. If using the "Default PhysX Viewer Script" as
    the Custom Viewer you will need to edit that script and save
    the result in order for gravity to be set every time you
    preview.</li>

    <li>Extra Data&mdash;Internally, the export of PhysX content
    from Maya happens in two phases. The first phase, inside the
    Maya plug-in, processes the hyper-graph to identify content
    for export. During this processing, nodes related to PhysX
    are identified and associated with their Gamebryo node
    counterparts. These Gamebryo nodes are tagged with Extra Data
    that encodes everything about the PhysX properties of the
    node. We use Extra Data because the plug-in must compile and
    execute without the PhysX SDK and Gamebryo's PhysX-specific
    classes. This process happens regardless of whether you wish
    to export the PhysX content: if PhysX content is present in
    the Maya scene, it always appears as Extra Data in Gamebryo
    nodes.

        <p class="indent1">As the scene graph is processed by the
        export scripts, the PhysX Extractor tool plug-in looks
        for the Extra Data in the nodes and converts it to the
        NiPhysX objects ready for streaming to NIF. As it does
        this, it removes the Extra Data from the nodes so there
        will be no PhysX-related Extra Data remaining after the
        PhysX Extractor has run.</p>

        <p class="indent1">If the PhysX Extractor tool plug-in is
        not used, the Extra Data remains in the nodes during
        streaming. However, the PhysX Cleaner tool plug-in can be
        used to remove the Extra Data with no other effects on
        the scene graph.</p>
