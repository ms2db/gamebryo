<h1>Texture Options Panel</h1>

<p>Texture option panel represents the standard options for all textures. These options are
described below.</p>

    <tbody>
        <tr>

            <td>
                Associate a Map with a particular UV set. It is very important to understand that
                the UV set is ONLY meaningful when associated with a particular object. This option
                is ONLY active when ONE object is selected. The "UV Set" options shows the UV sets
                associated with the selected object, so it will be different for each object. This
                setting allows objects to share the same NiMultiShader, but use different UV sets.

                <div class="NDLTDNote">
                    <span class="NDLTableNote">Note:</span> There is a fundamental difference
                    between Maya and Gamebryo UV sets. In Maya, a UV set might not contain all the
                    vertices of an object. In Gamebryo, however, each UV set always contains all
                    the vertices of an object. By default, the UV value of any vertices not in the
                    Maya UV set are (0,0). This may cause unexpected results.

                    <li>Bilerp Mip Nearest&mdash;Uses "nearest level mipmapping", then uses
                    "bilinear interpolation" on the result</li>

                    mipmap levels and then performs "linear mipmap interpolation" between the
                    results</li>

                    mipmap levels, then performs "linear mipmap interpolation" between the
                    results</li>

        <tr>
            <td>Max Anisotropy</td>

            <td>There is another useful filtering mode for textures used on surfaces that may be
            viewed nearly perpendicularly. Anisotropic filtering takes additional samples in the
            direction of maximum anisotropy, up to a maximum count. This maximum can be adjusted,
            and will be automatically clamped to what the runtime hardware maximum is. If
            anisotropic filtering isn't supported by hardware, it will be treated as trilinear
            filtering instead.</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Flip Book Texture</td>

            <td>Flip book textures are the simplest form of animation available. Different textures
            are applied to an object one after the next, creating the appearance of animation.
            Principal drawbacks of flip book animation are interpolation and size. There is no
            interpolation between images, so they jump from one to the next. Furthermore, having
            multiple textures for a single object is very memory expensive.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Start Frame (image)</td>

            <td>Specify the start number that will be appended to the texture file name. This
            number and the number that you specify in the <span class="NDLGUILabel">End Frame
            (image)</span> field determine what textures to load. For example, if you have a
            texture file "Fan.tga", and you enter 1 for the start frame and 4 for the end frame,
            then the files "Fan1.tga", "Fan2.tga", "Fan3.tga", and "Fan4.tga" will be loaded. Any
            number at the end of the original texture file name will be stripped off before the
            frame number is appended on. The number of significant digits in the file name will be
            determined by the original texture file name. For example, if the original file name
            was "Fan001.tga" then the file names will be "Fan001.tga", "Fan002.tga", "Fan003.tga",
            "Fan004.tga".</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>End Frame (image)</td>

            <td>Specify the end number that will be appended to the texture file name. For more
            information, see <span class="NDLGUILabel">Start Frame (image)</span> above.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Frames Per Second</td>

            <td>Set how fast the animation will play.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Cycle Type</td>

            <td>
                Set the looping behavior of the animation. There are three different types of
                animation cycles:

                <ul>
                    <li>Looping&mdash;animation will loop the frames continuously replaying the
                    animation from start to finish</li>

                    <li>Reverse&mdash;animations will cycle from the first frame to the last frame,
                    and then reverse direction back down to the first frame. (A pendulum would be a
                    good example of a reverse animation.)</li>

                    <li>Clamp&mdash;animation will play through exactly one time from the first
                    frame to the last</li>
                </ul>
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Start Time (in Frames)</td>

            <td>Set when the animation starts. Also affects what frame will be displayed at any
            given time.</td>
        </tr>

<p>An example of how filtering affects the look of your texture, especially at angles, is shown
here. Notice the difference between Trilerp on the far left and no filtering on the far right.</p>
