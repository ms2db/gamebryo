<h1>Detail Map</h1>

<p>Detail Maps are RGB maps that define high-frequency detail to be overlaid on a base texture. An
example of the need for detail maps is often seen in first-person games, when the player walks up
very close to a wall while facing it. With just a base texture, most applications cannot afford
infinite detail in the map, since that would require huge textures. Detail maps can alleviate this
problem by making use of an important observation: when the camera is close enough to a surface
that it looks blurry, only a small part of the base texture may be seen at any given time. Because
of this behavior, the detail map should be a pattern repeated at a higher frequency then the base
map. The "Detail Map" field is intended to hold the texture that will provide fine grain detail for
the base map.</p>

<p>As with dark maps, the color of the base texture and the color of the detail map are multiplied
together. Unlike dark maps, the results are multiplied by two. The detail map may then darken
<em>or</em> brighten the base texture. A pure white value will double the brightness of the base
map, while a pure black value will still make the base map's pixel become black.</p>

<p>You should always create a detail map so that its average color is 128,128,128, this pure grey
appears translucent when on the base map. In this way, when the object is viewed at a distance, it
will appear the same with or without the detail texture.</p>

<p>In some ways, it is similar to the effect of a dark map, using two small textures to create the
appearance of one very large texture. In fact, these techniques can be used together (easily
affordable on reasonably powerful hardware&mdash;check your application requirements), to create
textures that appear to be enormous. For example, a 64x64 detail texture repeated 32 times over a
base texture that is itself repeated 16 times over a dark map gives an overall texturing effect
that appears to be 64 times 32 times 16&mdash;effectively, what appears to be a 32768 x 32768 pixel
texture.</p>
