<h1>Export Display Options</h1>

<p>Use the Export Display Options dialog box to specify how you want to export your Maya art assets.</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Use this field...</th>
			<th>To...</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>Prompt for File Path</td>

			<td>Specify whether the system should prompt you when you export a file to the Exported File Path location. If this checkbox is not selected (checked), the system will force save the file to the Exported File Path location on export, over-writing if necessary. This is useful when you use Silent Export.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Export Non Visible Objects (as culled)</td>

			<td>Specify whether the system should export a Maya object with a &quot;Visibility&quot; attribute of &quot;OFF&quot; as part of the scene
 graph. In Gamebryo, after export, such Maya objects will have their
 &quot;AppCulled&quot; (not visible but present) attribute set. Select (check) this option to export a Maya object with a &quot;Visibility&quot; attribute of &quot;OFF&quot; as part of the scene graph.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Export Default Maya Cameras</td>

			<td>Specify whether or not you want to export the four default Maya cameras. The perspective camera is named &quot;perp&quot;. The other three orthogonal cameras are named &quot;top&quot;, &quot;side&quot;, and &quot;front&quot;.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Use Current Linear Working Units</td>

			<td>Specify whether to use the current linear working units. The default linear units in Maya are centimeters. By checking this option, the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in will export its values in the current linear working units. Valid working units are millimeter, centimeter, meter, inch, foot, and yard.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Auto Center LODs by Child Bounds</td>

			<td>One of the differences between Gamebryo and Maya comes
 with the function of LOD groups.&nbsp; In Gamebryo, the LOD group uses
 the distance from the camera to determine which child to display. When
 Maya creates a LOD group, by default, it is created at the origin, with
 the LOD levels offset from there.&nbsp; After export, it is the distance
 to the LOD group (i.e. origin) that is used in determining the current
 level of detail.&nbsp; To correct this common problem, Auto Center LODs
 will auto center each LOD based off the child's bounds.&nbsp; This capability
 removes a typical stumbling block many people encounter when using LOD.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Flip Textures instead of UV Coordinates</td>

			<td>During the load of all textures in Maya, textures are
 flipped along one axis.&nbsp;By default, Gamebryo flips the texture coordinates
 of objects at export so that the texture appears correctly if loaded from
 its original source (that is, before Maya flipped it). If this option
 is checked, the textures are exported flipped and the UV coordinates remain
 unchanged. This option only works if the textures are streamed internal
 to the NIF file. Note that UV coordinates in the Maya file are never flipped
 - they only appear flipped in Gamebryo.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Add Default Ambient for Maya Lights</td>

			<td>There is a subtle but fundamental difference between
 lighting in Maya and Gamebryo. Lights in Maya just have a &quot;color&quot;
 so the appearance of on object is based on the material diffuse color
 of an object and a small extra component added by the material ambient
 color.&nbsp; When this option is used a small extra component is added
 to exported lights to specify this extra component. The ambient color
 of the light is set to (32, 32, 32) to more closely resemble the lighting
 model in Maya.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Guarantee object names are unique</td>

			<td>During export the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in will preserve
 the object names found in the Maya scene graph. Since Maya allows objects
 to have duplicate names this can sometimes cause problems as the programmers
 search the exported NIF file looking for specific objects by name. Selecting
 this option will guarantee all object names are unique. If there are any
 duplicates the exporter will append a unique number to the object name.</td>

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Use Old Camera FOV (Not Recommended)</td>

			<td>Prior to Gamebryo 2.3 the camera FOV was not exported
 correctly. This has been fixed, but in order to maintain backwards compatibility,
 this field has been provided. This option is off by default.</td>
 		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td class="ColSpan" colspan="2">Window Size</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>640/480 | 800/600 | 1024/768 | 1280/1024</td>
			<td>Select which standard screen size to apply to the view window. This option only applies to the Win32 D3D viewers.</td>
		</tr>

			<td>Full Screen</td>
			<td>Create the view window at full screen dimensions. This option only applies to the Win32 D3D viewers.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td class="ColSpan" colspan="2">Scene Viewers</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Scene Viewers</td>
			<td>The renderer option allows the selection of the renderer used by the view window. This represents a simple Gamebryo viewer with limited controls. This doesn't start an outside application. Selecting this option will export using the "Controller Extractor" from the final scene and view it with the Gamebryo Animation Tool. Selecting this option will automatically export your scene and view it using the Gamebryo Asset Viewer.

<ul>
  <li>Xbox 360 Viewer&mdash;Selecting this option will automatically export your scene and view it on the Xbox 360</li>

  <li>PS3 Viewer&mdash;Selecting this option will automatically export your scene and view it on the PS3</li>

  <li>D3D10 Viewer&mdash;Selecting this option will automatically export your scene and view it in a D3D10 window. This will only work on D3D10-capable machines.</li>

  <li>D3D11 Viewer&mdash;Selecting this option will automatically export your scene and view it in a D3D11 window. This will only work on D3D11-capable machines.</li>

  <li>Custom Viewer&mdash;Selecting this option will allow the user to choose from a set of custom viewer scripts in the drop-down list below this menu item. These scripts may be custom viewers defined by your development team or custom viewers provided by the Gamebryo team and are loaded from the Script Template Directory listed above.</li>
</ul>

			<td class="ColSpan" colspan="2">Export for Platform/Renderer</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Export for Platform/Renderer</td>
			<td>Optimize your art for the intended platform.
<ul>
  <li>Generic (Default)&mdash;Export NiPixelData-based source textures and source cubemaps so that image conversion can be done at load time, if necessary. This setting works across all platforms, although it requires more memory and time at load for on-the-fly conversions.</li>

  <li>Platform-specific options&mdash;Can save memory and time at load time, but will not necessarily display in the PC-specific Gamebryo tools, nor on other platforms. To specify platform-specific textures for export, you may select any of the non-generic platform types with internal textures (in other words, textures are included in the main NIF). Specifically, these platform-specific internal texture choices include: Xbox 360, Playstation 3, D3D9, D3D10, and D3D11. The Finalize plug-in uses the renderer type to finalize the meshes into the renderer specific format. The Mesh Profile System assumes "Generic" is the least restrictive format. If you make certain assumptions based off of the renderer "Generic" will satisfy all conditions. This could create an asset that is not valid for some renderers. Using the "Default" profile will maintain compatibility for all renderers. If true "Generic" assets are required the assets should remain unfinalized.</li>

  <li>Optimize Mesh for Viewer&mdash;If checked, causes the meshes to go through time consuming optimization processes. This includes: View Independent, Vertex Cache, and Tri-Stripping. This option is not recommended.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Gamebryo Maya Plug-in Export Background Color</h4>

<p>The initial background color for the current renderer
 is modified from the &quot;Export All Options&quot; dialog.&nbsp; Adjustments
 of slider bars allow for fine-tuning of background colors.</p>
