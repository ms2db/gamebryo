<h1>Scripting the Art Pipeline in 3ds Max</h1>

<p>It is often useful to customize your export out of Max or
Maya. Perhaps you want to convert your level into portalled
geometry. Perhaps you need to create custom objects. Perhaps you
want to save into a different file format. All of these options
are possible by taking advantage of the Gamebryo Plug-in
Framework.</p>

<p>Information on how to take advantage of the Tool Plug-in
Framework can be found in the <a href=
"../../Art/Other/Introduction_to_the_Gamebryo_Tool_Plug_in_Framework.htm">
Tool Plug-in Framework</a> section. The rest of the information
in this section applies specifically to how to use the Tool
Plug-ins within 3ds Max.</p>

<h2>Script Types</h2>

<p>Scripts are divided into four separate categories to allow
reusability. The Gamebryo Max Plug-in's <a href=
"Gamebryo_3ds_max_Export_Options1.htm">Export Options dialog</a>
allows you to choose a process and export script to be executed
each time you export the scene. When previewing the scene, only
the process script will get executed. Instead of executing the
export script, a viewer script will be used depending upon what
type of preview is being done.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Import Scripts</b> are composed entirely of process
    plug-ins. These plug-ins should not be used with 3ds
    Max.</li>

    <li><b>Process Scripts</b> are composed entirely of process
    plug-ins. These plug-ins are always run whenever you export
    or view the file.</li>

    <li><b>Viewer Scripts</b> are composed of one or more viewer
    plug-ins. Additional process scripts for the viewer can be
    specified here but are not easily edited in the
    user-interface. These scripts directly correspond with the
    radio buttons in the Viewer Selection panel in the Gamebryo
    Utility. New viewer plug-ins can be used through the Custom
    Viewer radio button. These scripts are only run when the View
    button is pressed in the Gamebryo Utility.</li>

    <li><b>Export Scripts</b> are composed of one or more export
    scripts. These kinds of scripts are run only when you export
    out a file.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Script Directories</h2>

<p>The Gamebryo Max plug-in loads the script template files
from:</p>

<p>\3dsmax\plugins\MaxImmerse\scripts</p>

<h2>Plug-in Directories</h2>

<p>The Gamebryo Max plug-in loads all of the plug-ins from the
directory <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\SDK\Win32\DLL\ToolPlugins</span>.
By default, the <span class="NDLSystemFont">EMERGENT_PATH</span>
environment variable is set by the installer.</p>

<h2>Provided Default Scripts</h2>

<p>The following scripts are provided by default in the Gamebryo
Max Plug-in installation.</p>

<h3>Process Scripts:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Default Process Script</b> This script runs the Create
    ABV, Optimization, and Stripification plug-ins with their
    default parameters.</li>

    <li><b>Scene Graph Optimizations Only</b> This script just
    runs the SceneGraph Optimization plug-in with its default
    settings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Viewer Scripts:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Default DX Viewer Script</b> This script is used by
    the DX Viewer radio button in the Gamebryo
    Utility&rarr;Viewer Selection rollout.</li>

    <li><b>Default KFM Viewer Script</b> - This script is used by
    the KFM Viewer radio button in the Gamebryo
    Utility&rarr;Viewer Selection rollout.</li>

    <li><b>Default SceneImmerse Viewer Script</b> - This script
    is used by the Scene Viewer radio button in the Gamebryo
    Utility&rarr;Viewer Selection rollout.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Export Scripts:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Default Export Script</b> This script exports out a
    single NIF file.</li>

    <li><b>Multiple KF Export With NIF Script</b> This script
    exports out a single NIF file and multiple KF files depending
    on what animations the Controller Extractor plug-in
    finds.</li>

    <li><b>Multiple KF Export Without NIF Script</b> This script
    exports multiple KF files depending on what animations the
    Controller Extractor plug-in finds but does not export out
    the NIF file.</li>

    <li><b>Single KF Export With NIF Script</b> This script
    exports out a single NIF file and a single composite KF file
    of the animations that the Controller Extractor plug-in
    finds.</li>

    <li><b>Single KF Export Without NIF Script</b> This script
    exports out a single composite KF file of the animations that
    the Controller Extractor plug-in finds, but does not export
    out the NIF file.</li>
</ul>
