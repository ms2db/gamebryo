<h1>Multi/Sub-Object and Triangle/Mesh Ratios</h1>

<p>A convenient way of texturing an object in Max is to 
 use the Multi/Sub-Object material. However, Gamebryo only supports one 
 material per mesh because most hardware can only handle one material per 
 set of triangles. When the Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in encounters a Multi/Sub-Object 
 material it must split the Max Mesh into multiple NiMesh objects (one 
 for each material).</p>

<p><b>Over-use of Multi/Sub-Objects 
 is the most common offender in terms of performance in most data sets 
 support receives.</b></p>

<p>If used indiscriminately, Multi/Sub-Object materials 
 can lay waste to the triangle/mesh ratio and you end up with a single 
 object made of many little pieces. Multi/Sub-Object materials do not need 
 to be completely avoided but they should be used cautiously and with a 
 consideration of the triangle/mesh ratio constraints. </p>

<p><b>When doing characters 
 and discrete objects, the concept of a single texture 'Skin' for the subject 
 is recommended</b>. An item made of 1 or 2 objects draws faster than one 
 made of 12 or 13.&nbsp; This is not to say, &quot;Never use Multi-Subs&quot; 
 as they are very convenient. However, as an example we have received a 
 support question on performance with a single character that had a multi-sub 
 material on it. He was created in such a way that when exported, this 
 single character turned into 42 different objects! This laid waste to 
 performance since each of those 42 objects became individual meshes each 
 with non-trivial overhead.</p>
