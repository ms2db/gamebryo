<p>The soldier model pictured above uses the same proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
as mentioned earlier, but a couple other aspects of modeling the
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
come into play here. The first picture above shows a proxy
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
hierarchy defined and tailored for the soldier in figure mode
(the "Figure Soldier"). The second shows a proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
hierarchy defined and tailored for the Soldier moving in his
backward walk cycle (the "Walk Soldier").</p>

<p>First of all, the basic proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
for the main body parts - torso, legs, feet, arms, hands &amp;
head - were modeled in figure mode and are the same for both
models. Because a skin-and-bones character does not have
individual skins for each body part, these proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
were attached to the underlying bones of the character, instead.
While the bones will not be rendered (they should be set to
"hidden" when exported to NIF format), they do remain with the
model in order to control the positioning of the skin. Because of
these attachments, the proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
move with the character when he is animated (right picture).</p>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ALWAYS</span>
<a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Propagation_Control_Flags.htm">propagation
flag</a> is vital to implementing this <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
tree scheme, allowing a dynamic hierarchy of <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
to be defined for a dynamic object, such as (but not limited to)
an animated skin-and-bones character. The flag is only applicable
to <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Collision_Data.htm">collision
data</a> attached to an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiNode.htm">NiNode</a></span>-derived
class.</p>

<p>Many of the proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
for the soldier use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ALWAYS</span> <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Propagation_Control_Flags.htm">propagation
flag</a>, including the torso, legs and arms. Because of the way
collision propagation works, proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
should be defined for all children of a node that uses
<span class="NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ALWAYS</span> and should
likely be defined all the way down the tree until <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_NEVER</span> proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
are reached. In order to better clarify these concepts, we will
look at the definition of the soldier proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
in detail from the top bone down, following the schematic diagram
(for the "Walk Soldier") pictured below.</p>

    <p class="FigureCaption">Animated Character Example
    Hierarchy</p>
</div>

<h3>Bip01</h3>

<p>Bip01 is the main attachment point for the character in the
scene graph. Because the figure-mode skin geometry will be placed
as children of this node, we do not want to start collision
testing at Bip01, but rather at its first child.</p>

<h3>Bip01 Pelvis</h3>

<p>There are a few "free" bones in the character
hierarchy&mdash;ones that don't control a major body part with
which we are concerned about colliding. We will take advantage of
these free bones to define culling proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
for larger groups of bones. If a potential collision is not found
at this level, then testing will not continue any further into
the character. By defining one of these free bones for the Bip01
Pelvis, we end up with an overall bound for the entire
character.</p>

<p>This setup is very important, because, otherwise, the various
nodes with collision data set to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ALWAYS</span> would cause many nodes to
be tested for every other collidable object in the scene. Also,
by attaching it to the pelvis, the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
will rotate with the character as it moves, allowing us to define
a fairly tight bound for him.</p>

<p>The size and shape of this proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
will be determined by what you plan to do with the character. You
could define one large bound that would enclose the character no
matter what the animation was. This choice is perhaps the most
desirable, as you won't have to keep multiple versions of a
character around. The undesirable part of this approach is that
it will not be as efficient as a tighter bound tailored for a
particular situation. In the "Figure Soldier" model, this
<a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">
ABV</a> is a large sphere, which has a lot of wasted space in
front and behind of the model. In the "Walk Soldier" model,
because we know that he will never stretch his arms out during
his animation cycle, we fit a much tighter capsule <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
to his geometry.</p>

<p>We can set the <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Propagation_Control_Flags.htm">propagation
flag</a> for this <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
as <span class="NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ON_SUCCESS</span> which
means that propagation will only occur on a successful collision.
Also, by default, no callback will be called.</p>

<h3>Bip01 Spine</h3>

<p>The Bip01 Spine is the bone that branches out to other bones.
To it we will attach a tight-fitting box to encompass the lower
part of the torso of the character. To make sure that collision
testing occurs on the other parts of the character, we will set
the propagation flag to <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ALWAYS</span>. We could have attached
the torso box to one of the other spine linkages, but then the
first spine bone would have been useless, as it couldn't be used
to generate any culling proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
that would have done anything other than what the Bip01 Pelvis
already did.</p>

<h3>Bip01 Spine1</h3>

<p>Bip01 Spine1 is another "free" bone, as the torso <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
is already enclosing the spine. Rather than having nothing or
placing a dummy <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ALWAYS</span> with a <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">NOTEST</span> <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Collision_Control_Flags.htm">collision
flag</a>, we will take this opportunity to do some more culling,
creating another <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ON_SUCCESS</span> <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
that culls out the upper body. The "Figure Soldier" has a
horizontal capsule <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
surrounding the arms, head and chest, while the "Walk Soldier"
has a vertically oriented capsule <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
that encloses the same body parts.</p>

<h3>Bip01 Spine2</h3>

<p>This bone is used to enclose the upper portion of the torso.
While the lower torso box could have been made large enough to
cover the entire torso, this technique allows the bounds to more
closely follow the character is he twists or bends over. Besides,
there wasn't anything else to do with this node.</p>

<h3>Bip01 Neck</h3>

<p>Bip01 Neck could have been left without collision data,
however, we decided to go ahead and add a small sphere
representation.</p>

<h3>Bip01 L Clavicle &amp; Bip01 R Clavicle</h3>

<p>These bones are also buried inside the upper pelvis, but since
we now have a notion of "left and right", we will use them to
create culling <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
for the arms. Culling is still quite useful, so we might as well
see if we can eliminate the tests against the three other bounds
that make up each arm. The <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ON_SUCCESS</span> flag will be used
here, too.</p>

<p>The character animation really comes into play here. The
Clavicles will swing with the torso, pretty much, but their
motions can be quite different from that of the arms that are
attached to them. For a generalized cull hierarchy, these
<a href="../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">
ABV</a>s will need to be quite large to capture all the potential
motion of the character's arms. For a character that's standing
like a scarecrow ("Figure Soldier" model), these proxy <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
can be quite small. For the "Walk Soldier", they had to be quite
a bit larger and carefully positioned so that they would capture
most, if not all, of the character's motion (you might settle for
some minor artifacts, such as elbow-tips passing through other
objects, in an effort to keep your performance up).</p>

<h3>Bip01 L Upper Arm, Bip01 L Fore Arm.</h3>

<p>The arm segments are capsule <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>s
with <span class="NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_ALWAYS</span>
propagation. They need to be overlapped somewhat to make sure
that the rounded caps of the capsule ABVs catch all the geometry
during animation.</p>

<h3>Bip01 L Hand &amp; Bip01 R Hand</h3>

<p>We now reach the first end nodes of the collision hierarchy.
While there might be finger bones in the model, we don't care
about them in this application, and will use the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_NEVER</span> propagation flag on the
boxes defined for these proxies.</p>

<h3>Bip01 Head</h3>

<p>Similar to the hands, the Bip01 Head is an end node of the
hierarchy, approximated by a box <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Alternate_Bounding_Volumes.htm">ABV</a>
with <span class="NDLSystemFont">PROPAGATE_NEVER</span>
propagation. In this case, we don't care about collision with the
hat, so the proxy box is not made large enough to surround the
hat.</p>

<h3>Bip01 L Thigh, Bip01 L Calf, Bip01 L Foot.</h3>

<p>The leg hierarchy behaves similarly to the arm hierarchy,
except that there are no free bones for culling out each side as
in the upper body. With different bone hierarchies, perhaps this
approach could have been possible.</p>
