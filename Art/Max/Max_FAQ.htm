<a name="Where_Max"></a><h2>Q: I have installed Gamebryo and started up Max. Where is Gamebryo in Max?</h2>

<h3>A: There are a number of locations in the Max interface that enable you to use Gamebryo features.</h3>

<p> You can find the Gamebryo Shader in the Material Editor window under the "Shader Basic Parameters" rollout. The "Gamebryo Shader" is right underneath "Blinn" in the rollout.</p>

<p>You can find the Gamebryo Preview windows under the Utilities panel on the right of the command panel. You will need to click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">More</span> button under the Utilities rollout the first time you bring it up. You should add it as a button under the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Sets</span> button when have a second because you will be accessing this part of Gamebryo often.</p>

<p>You can find the export dialog under <span class="NDLGUILabel">File > Export</span> and selecting "Gamebryo .NIF/.KF/.KFM"</p>

<p>You can also find many additional tools under the Maxscript button under Utilities panel. </p>

<p>We recommend that you create a custom toolbar by going to the "Customize / Customize UI Scheme" dialog. Under the "Toolbars" tab, select "Gamebryo Tools" from the "Category" rollout. Add these buttons to an existing rollout or a new rollout. Save this scheme as DefaultUI.CUI so it will load every time you start max.</p>

<p>The rest of the Gamebryo Max Plug-in is made to be as transparent as possible. When you are working with Max and its tools, you are working with Gamebryo also.</p>

<a name="Character_Studio"></a><h2>Q: I have a Character-Studio character that animates correctly in Max, but when I look at him in Gamebryo, the mesh is offset from the skin. I have attached the skin to the Bip01 of the character. What is wrong?</h2>

<h3>A: Do not attach a skin that is bound to a bone rig or CS rig to the root node of that hierarchy the space warp is bound to.</h3>

<p>Max should not let this be possible. What is actually happening is that you are translating the skin twice: Once for the space-warp binding and then again because it is attached as a child to the moving rig. A skin should never be attached to the hierarchy that is moving it if it has a space-warp (Skin or Physique) binding to it also. You can create a node above the Bip01 node, or use Max5's character node to organize a bone structure and skin together.</p>

<a name="Stripify"></a><h2>Q: Why does it take longer to export when I have the Stripify Option on?</h2>

<h3>A: It may take longer to export with the Stripify option on in your scene.</h3>

<p>In some cases, a complex scene might take up to 10 minutes longer to export. However, you can get a 30 to 70% performance increase using the Stripify option. While building and examining a Gamebryo asset, you may want this to be off for convenience and faster turnover on your iterations. However, make sure that your final exports have this option enabled for best performance.</p>

<a name="Base_Mesh"></a><h2>Q: Why isn't the base mesh of my Morph correct?</h2>

<h3>A: This symptom often occurs when a morph's base mesh is exported as the first frame of an animation on the time slider.</h3>

<p>You should ensure that the first frame matches your base geometry. We also recommend that you use the Morph modifier rather than the Morph compound object.</p>

<a name="Particle_System_Transparency"></a><h2>Q: My particle system uses transparency. Why does it disappear from certain positions?</h2>

<h3>A: Large particle systems that read and write the z-buffer are the most common cause of this symptom.</h3>

<p>To work around this issue, we recommend that you add &quot;zMode10&quot; to the particle system's User-Defined Properties. It is also possible that you will need help from a programmer, who will be able to help make the particle in the scene 'Always draw'. This modification will ensure that the particle system will not clip out of view at unexpected angles. </p>

<a name="Animation_Diff"></a><h2>Q: Why do some animations look different when I view them in both Gamebryo and Max?</h2>

<h3>A: There are subtle differences between how Max shows time and how Gamebryo shows time.</h3>

<p>Through Max's interface, you see time based on frames. On the other hand, Gamebryo displays time continuously, interpolating between frames. That way, if your getting 20 fps or 60 fps, you still see the same result based on the global time, not your frame rate.</p>

<p>This problem arises most often when you view animations in Max in which movement takes a single frame. Max only renders &quot;Frames&quot; at whatever frame rate you specify. Gamebryo will render as fast as it can, sampling the animation curves at the current application time. Because Gamebryo renders much faster, you see the animation as it actually is.</p>

<a name="Animation_Export"></a><h2>Q: Why aren't all of my animations exporting?</h2>

<h3>A: In some cases, Gamebryo must sample the animations because the keyframes are either an unsupported type or unavailable to the exporter.</h3>

<p>If this is true, the exporter tries to find the time frame to sample against. In some cases, as with Character Studio, the time frame is not accurately reported. In this case, we use the presence of note track keys to indicate the start and stop times for sampling.</p>

<a name="Animation_Memory"></a><h2>Q: Sometimes my animations are bigger in memory than I want. Why is that?</h2>

<h3>A: In some cases, Gamebryo must sample the animations because the keyframes are either an unsupported type or they are unavailable to the exporter.</h3>

<p> For more information, see <a href="Position__Rotation__And_Scale.htm">Animating Position, Rotation, And Scale in 3ds Max</a>.</p>

<a name="Instanced_Objects"></a><h2>Q: Why aren't my instanced objects being cloned?</h2>

<h3>A: This will only occur when unique non-uniform scales have
been applied to the object and when the object is skinned.</h3>

<p>In both cases, a modifier has been applied that makes the object unique. We support uniform scale, movement and rotation of instances. When a non-uniform scale is applied, the vertex relationships are modified and the object must become unique.</p>


<a name="Not_Bitmap"></a><h2>Q: I am using the map type other than Bitmap. Why isn't it exporting?</h2>

<h3>A: This is probably happening because you are attempting to use an usupported format.</h3>

<p>Gamebryo supports BMP, TGA, PNG, DDS, SGI, HDR, and internally stored textures in a .NIF. PICT, TIFF, JPG, and so on are not supported. If you need support for one of these formats, contact Emergent Technical Support and we'll see what we can do!</p>

<a name="Transparent_Textures"></a><h2>Q: How do I get transparent textures in Gamebryo?</h2>

<h3>A: Gamebryo uses the alpha of your Base texture for Transparency.</h3>

<p>If you wish to use textures with alpha, use one of the Gamebryo supported formats like a 32-bit TGA format or the DirectX .DDS format that store 8-bit information into the alpha channel of the image. If the image has alpha, the Gamebryo Shader will automatically use it for transparency unless otherwise specified in the Shader parameters. </p>

<p>If you want to have alpha on a per material basis, simply adjust the Material Alpha property in the Material rollout. (Black is transparent and white is opaque.)</p>

<a name="Render_to_Texture"></a><h2>Q: I am trying to do Render to Texture lightmaps and the texture is coming out black. What is wrong?</h2>

<h3>A: Make sure that the ambient color for your render to texture is correct.</h3>

<p>You need to make sure that the render to texture color is not black. Make sure that there are lights affecting your object.</p>

<a name="Checkerboard"></a><h2>Q: I export a NIF file with platform-specific textures for Xbox 360 or Playstation3, but the texture is a colorful checkerboard when I look at the NIF in Asset Viewer or the other tools. What is happening?</h2>

<h3>A: There are a number of possible causes for images failing to render properly.</h3>

<p>If platform-specific textures are used, then assuming that the specific platform can support the pixel format in question, the renderer will load the associated persistent source texture renderer data directly into a renderer-specific resource at application load time. This mechanism bypasses the application-level
 <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>
 object and all <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiImageConverter.htm">NiImageConverter</a></span>-based texture conversion at load time entirely.  The primary motivation for such an approach is improved memory usage and performance at load time.</p>

<p>A caveat to this approach is that the texture is configured specifically for a target platform (or graphics card), and may not be loadable for use with alternative platforms or graphics cards, or with tools on the PC. If a texture is configured specifically for one target platform or graphics card, but an attempt is made to load it on a platform or graphics card that can't support it, <a href="../../Programmer/Texturing/Failures.htm">error replacement textures</a> are used to indicate load-time errors.</p>

<p>If application requirements dictate fully general support of textures within a NIF file on multiple platforms or graphics cards, then <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based
 textures may be used, because they enable on-the-fly texture format conversions at load time. To specify <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPixelData.htm">NiPixelData</a></span>-based
 textures for export from the art packages, you may select one of four export
 options:  (1) &quot;generic&quot; platform type, but include textures in main
 NIF, (2) save textures as separate NIFs, (3) textures as original images, or
 (4) textures as original images VRAM.</p>

<p>However, the best recommendation may be to work with generic textures with all the tools throughout a development cycle. Then, prior to final release, textures may be re-exported specifically for various target platforms. This approach offers the most flexibility during the majority of the development cycle, yet also offers the best performance for the final application version.</p>

<p>See <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Programmer/Object_Systems/Streaming.htm#TextureStreamingOptions">Texture Streaming Options</a></span> for Internal Textures or the description of
 <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData.htm">NiPersistentSrcTextureRendererData</a> in the Main Class Reference for more details.</p>

<a name="Grayed_Viewer_Options"></a><h2>Q: All of my viewer options are grayed out, why is this?</h2>

<h3>A: Your system might not have all the necessary scripts installed.</h3>

<p>Make sure that you have a <span class="NDLSystemFont">3dsmax\plugins\maximmerse\scripts</span>
 folder and that it is not empty. Look for scripts like "Default DX Viewer.script". If they do not exist, then re-install.</p>

<a name="Error_Load_Scripts"></a><h2>Q: I am getting errors loading script files.</h2>

<h3>A: This could be caused by a script or configuration error.</h3>

<p>Make sure that you have scripts stored in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">3dsMax\Plugins\MaxImmerse\Scripts</span> directory. If you are continuing to have errors, delete the script file with the name mentioned in the error message. If you still have errors, delete your <span class="NDLSystemFont">mimmerse.ini</span> file under <span class="NDLSystemFont">3dsMax\Plugcfg\</span>.</p>

<a name="Error_Parse_Shaders"></a><h2>Q: I am getting error messages when parsing shaders.</h2>

<h3>A: Make sure that the NSF file properties are correct.</h3>

<p>Make sure that the NSF files are marked with read and write properties.</p>

<a name="Load_Failure"></a><h2>Q: Why can't I launch Max with the Gamebryo Max plug-in? It fails to load the plug-in.</h2>

<h3>A: This is probably caused by a license or configuration problem.</h3>

<p>The Gamebryo plug-in requires a valid license code to work. Additionally, it depends on external DLLs that are installed with the installer. Visit Emergent's <a href="https://pulse.emergent.net/support/" target="_blank">Online Support Portal</a> for more information.</p>
