            install the older PhysX Max Plug-in on an older version of Max to work with the cloth.

<p>PhysX cloth is authored in Max using the PhysX Max plug-in. 
 Gamebryo's plug-in understands the data created by the cloth authoring 
 process and uses it to correctly associate cloth with rendered Gamebryo 
 geometry. This page describes how Gamebryo treats this data and provides 
 tips for effectively authoring cloth for Gamebryo. </p>

<h2>Cloth Properties</h2>

<p>The PhysX Max interface exposes several properties that 
 control the behavior of the cloth. See the PhysX documentation for a complete 
 description of these flags. Of note is the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Tearable</span> 
 flag, which Gamebryo interprets as enabling tearing of both the cloth 
 and its attachments. If the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Auto Attach</span> 
 check is set, then the cloth is automatically attached to any geometry 
 that it intersects. </p>

<h2>Gamebryo-Specific Setup</h2>

<p>By default, PhysX cloth meshes will not update their 
 normals or NBT frames as they deform. This can produce very incorrect 
 results if the cloth deforms more than a small amount, and can also make 
 it more difficult to perceive the cloth's motion. To enable normal and 
 NBT updating, add the string &quot;NiClothUpdateNormals&quot; to the UserProps 
 for the cloth object.</p>

<p>In addition to the above properties, you can also specify 
 the collision group for the cloth using the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 HREF="Gamebryo_Rigid_Body_Extras_with_Max.htm">NiPhysXActorGroup</a></span> 
 User Prop. </p>

<h2>Tips for Authoring Cloth</h2>

<p>Certain aspects of the cloth authoring interface may 
 cause confusion. We discuss them here. </p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Cloth objects must 
 have only a single material attached for the entire mesh. If you need 
 different textures on different parts of a cloth object, combine the textures 
 into one map and use UVs to select appropriate pieces of the whole texture 
 for each portion of the mesh.</li>
	
	<li>Many cloth parameters 
 have a limited range of valid values. Unfortunately the PhysX Max plug-in 
 does not respect these limits, while in other cases it does not allow 
 valid values to be set. Consult the PhysX SDK documentation on the <span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NxClothDesc</span> class and <span class="NDLSystemFont">NxClothMeshDesc</span> 
 class for the range of valid values. If the interface prevents you from 
 setting a particular valid value, you can modify the User Props on the 
 object directly. If a value is inaccurate, you will get a message either 
 at export or when you try to open the NIF file in the PhysX Nif Viewer. 
 </li>
	
	<li>The run-time cloth 
 system in Gamebryo only support NDL format NBT coordinate frames. You 
 must explicitly specify the NBT Generation method in the Gamebryo Shader 
 roll-out of the Material Editor if the cloth has a shader on it that requires 
 NBT frames (such as a normal or parallax map). If you forget to do this, 
 the cloth will generate an error message when it is loaded into a Gamebryo 
 application.</li>
	
	<li>You may find that cloth 
 seems to not respect attachments, particularly if the cloth is tearable. 
 The problem is that the attachment is immediately tearing when the cloth 
 initially settles. You can prevent this by reducing the mesh resolution 
 of the cloth (effectively creating longer edges), by increasing the tear 
 factor, or by reducing the density of the cloth (which reduces the force 
 of gravity on it). Also check that the cloth is actually intersecting 
 the shape you wish to attach it to, and note that you cannot attach to 
 a concave mesh shape.</li>
	
	<li>Cloth that has the 
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">Hardware</span> flag turned on will not simulate 
 on software. The hardware option in Max PhysX Cloth roll-out takes precedence 
 any per-prop settings in the <a HREF="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor Tool Plug-in</a>. You will receive an error message when creation 
 of the cloth prop fails in a Gamebryo application. This will happen even 
 if you try to create hardware cloth in a software scene with no PhysX 
 hardware available. For applications that run on both PhysX hardware and 
 software you will require two versions of the exported asset.</li>
</ul>
