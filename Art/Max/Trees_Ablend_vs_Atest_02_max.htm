<h1>Trees Ablend vs ATest 02.max</h1>

<p>The Trees Ablend vs ATest 02.max sample illustrates different ways to apply
transparency to foliage, specifically focusing on Alpha blending vs. Alpha
testing.</p>

<p>One common use of textured transparency is with billboard or cross plane
trees. The two trees are shaded by the materials "Alpha Blend Mat" and "Alpha
Test Mat," with the respective assignment of material to individual tree.
Running the sample displays two identical trees, except for their transparency.
The alpha blended tree has softer edges than the alpha tested tree, but the
alpha blended tree flickers because of sorting conflicts. For this reason,
alpha testing is the recommended alternative for this type of situation.</p>

                These materials have their "Apply Mode" option changed from
                MODULATE to REPLACE. This approach was adopted to eliminate any
                artifacts from the default Max lighting. REPLACE mode instruct
                Gamebryo to ignore both vertex colors and dynamic lights and is
                usually used when all necessary lighting has been included in
                the textures or will be provided via dark maps.

<p>With alpha testing, pixels that fail the alpha test are not written to the
frame buffer. To further demonstrate the behavior of alpha testing, try
changing the "Test Mode" of the "Alpha Test Mat" from GREATER to LESSEQUAL.
This setting will show those pixels that were being eliminated earlier. It
should appear as a halo around the tree. If you also change the transparency
mode of the material to "Standard", the pixels that are totally transparent on
<span class="NDLSystemFont">smalloakfour.tga</span> will not appear for either
setting of "Test Mode". In one case, they are ignored. In another case, they
are alpha blended into the scene.</p>
