<h1>Morphing Faces on Skinned Characters</h1>

<p>Use the standard morpher modifier in Max and set up
your morph targets through that interface. A maxscript could be
generated to make custom sliders for this. Gamebryo fully
supports morphing but has no special interfaces; it goes through
the standard pipeline just like skinning.</p>

<h2>Warning on Performance</h2>

<p>Having a morpher modifier on top of a skin or physique modifier is <em>very</em>
slow. This is because all of the vertices must get passed through
the pipeline twice&mdash;once for the skin updates and again for
the morph updates.</p>

<h2>Correct Method of Using Morph and Skin Together</h2>

<p>It is recommended that you split the "face area" of the head
into a separate mesh. The head mesh can remain skinned, with the
vertices bordering the face mesh all set to 100% weights to the
head bone (so they move absolutely with the head bone). The face
mesh should be linked directly to the head bone with no skinning,
so that it also moves 100% with the head bone and the seams of
the non-skinned face and skinned head match up. The morpher modifier is only applied to
the face mesh and not the head mesh. This way each mesh is only
passed down the pipeline once.</p>

<h2>Smoothing any Seams Between the Head and Face</h2>

<p>When you have two meshes that line up vertex for vertex, you
will still get a seam because the normals at the edge of each
mesh differ. Gamebryo has a special export plug-in that smoothes
these normals and makes the seams disappear. When you export, go
to the Process Script edit dialog and add the "Unify Normals
Plug-in v1.0" to the process list. Both the head and face mesh
need to be tagged with "NiUnifyNormals" in the User-defined
properties so the plug-in will recognize they need to be
smoothed.</p>

<h2>Updating Normals</h2>

<p>When an object with a Morph modifier is exported from max, by
default, its surface normals do not update each frame in
Gamebryo. In most cases this works well because there is almost
no visual difference from updating the normals, and recalculating
the normals per-vertex can be very expensive. In some cases,
however, the artist will want Gamebryo to recalculate the surface
normals each frame. This is the case when the surface deforms
significantly. If this is needed, surface normals will be updated
when the string 'NiMorphUpdateNormals' is added to the
user-defined properties of the object.</p>

<p>This method will give you fast and accurate results.</p>
