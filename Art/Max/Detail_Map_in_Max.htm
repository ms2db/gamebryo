<h1>Detail Map in Max</h1>

<p>Detail maps are r,g,b maps that define high-frequency detail to be overlaid
on a base texture. An example of the need for detail maps is often seen in
first-person shooter games, when the player walks up very close to a wall while
facing it. With just a base texture, most applications cannot afford infinite
detail in the map (since that would require huge textures), so the filtering
produces a blurred, soft image. This result is jarring to players who had been
drawn into believing in the otherwise detailed game world. Detail maps can
alleviate this problem by using an important observation: when the camera is
close enough to a surface that it looks blurry, they can only see a small part
of the base texture at a time. Because of this behavior the detail map should
be a highly repeated noise pattern. The "Detail" map field is intended to hold
the texture that will provide fine grain detail for the base map.</p>

<p>As with dark maps, the color of the base texture and the color of the detail
map are multiplied together. Unlike dark maps, the result is multiplied by two.
The detail map may thus darken <em>or</em> brighten the base texture. A pure
white value will double the brightness of the base map while a pure black value
will still make the base map's pixel become black. You should usually create a
detail map so that its average color is 128,128,128, leaving the base map
unchanged. In this way, when the object is viewed at a distance, it will appear
the same with or without the detail texture.</p>

<p>In some ways, it is similar to the effect of a dark map, using two small
textures to create the appearance of one very large texture. In fact, these
techniques can be used together (easily affordable on reasonably powerful
hardware&mdash;check your application requirements), to create textures that
appear to be enormous. For example, a 64x64 detail texture repeated 32 times
over a base texture that is itself repeated 16 times over a dark map gives an
overall texturing effect that appears to be 64 times 32 times
16&mdash;effectively, what appears to be a 32,768x32,768-pixel texture.</p>
