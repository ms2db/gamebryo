<h1>Decal Map in Max</h1>

<p>Decal maps are useful for adding confined detail to a large
base map. Examples include damage scorch marks, bullet holes,
skid marks, and lettering. The "Decal" map field holds a texture
that will be alpha blended on top of the base texture. Unlike
other forms of multi-texture, a single object may have more than
one decal map. Unlike other "slots" in the multi-texture
property, there is an entire array of decal slots. Decals are
applied in the order in which they appear in the array-creating a
layering effect. The Gamebryo 3ds Max Plug-in will translate each
texture listed in the "Composite" material into a decal texture. 
As a result, decals can be made to overlay not only the base
texture, but each other as well. Each decal can have its own set
of texture coordinates (UVs), and can thus be applied
independently.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/image033.jpg" width="576" height="468" alt=
    "image033 (30K)">

</div>

<p>A detail and a Decal map are applied to the scene shown here.
The decal is the badly drawn crack in the wall while the detail
map is the tiling dirt applied to the wood floor. Dark maps are
also applied to the floor and walls to create the static lighting
effects.</p>
