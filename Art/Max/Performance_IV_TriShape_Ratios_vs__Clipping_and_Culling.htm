<h1>Triangle/Mesh Ratios vs. Clipping and Culling </h1>

<p>These two issues, the triangle/mesh ratio and the culling/clipping 
 behavior, place somewhat contradictory demands on you. To improve the 
 triangle/mesh ratio you must have the most triangles in a mesh possible 
 (mesh collapsing, increasing the number of triangles in the mesh, etc.). 
 Simultaneously, the meshes must be kept compact to allow for efficient 
 culling. There is no simple solution to this problem and you must constantly 
 balance the two constraints. In general, triangles should be grouped into 
 meshes so that culling will still be effective, but the meshes should 
 contain the most triangles possible.</p>

<p>For example, when modeling the four walls of a room, 
 if the walls are relatively complex, each wall should be in its own mesh. 
 Having all the walls in a single mesh would improve the triangle/mesh 
 ratio but would force clipping on all the geometry. By dividing the walls 
 into four meshes, two of them will usually be culled leaving the other 
 two to be clipped. However, if the walls were very simple (i.e. 2 triangles 
 each) then it might make sense to clump all the wall triangles together 
 to avoid having several 2 triangle meshes.</p>

<p>In modern hardware, side plane clipping is avoided as 
 much as possible through various tricks. Near plane clipping remains a 
 problem, however.</p>
