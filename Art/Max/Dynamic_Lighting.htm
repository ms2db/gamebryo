<h1>Dynamic Lighting with 3ds Max</h1>

<p>Often, the easiest way to set up lighting is with standard 
 lights in Max. However, dynamic lights are expensive, and their use is 
 overkill if the light is not moving. If you need a light to move 
 around the scene, then use dynamic lights. The way the lighting works 
 is to compute the lighting on either each vertex or each pixel for every 
 frame; it should be used judiciously and with as few lights as possible so 
 your application can run at the highest speed.</p>
 
<p>Different types of lights have different performance
 characteristics. Directional lights are the most efficient, followed by
 omni lights, and spot lights are the most expensive. The difference in
 performance between light types is even more important when performing 
 lighting on a per-pixel basis.</p>

<p>By default, diffuse lighting and specular highlights are
 computed on a per-vertex basis. However, if the material uses a normal map
 or a parallax map, lighting must be computed on a per-pixel basis. This can
 have more attractive results but will be more expensive to compute. If the
 object being rendered is a receiver of dynamic shadows, lighting must also
 be computed on a per-pixel basis.</p>

<p>Another type of dynamic lighting is a Projected Texture 
 Effect. This option is outlined in the section on Projected Multi-Texturing. 
 Projected textures are not dependent on the tessellation of an object, 
 but the lighting is still computed every frame, so it is still expensive.
