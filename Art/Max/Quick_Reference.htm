<h2>Transparency Considerations</h2>

<p><b>Issue:</b> Object has completely opaque or completely transparent regions only</p>

<p>What you should use: Alpha testing</p>

<p><b>Issue:</b> Object has regions that are semi-transparent</p>

<p>What you should do: Alpha blending</p>

<p><b>Issue:</b> Object has some semi-transparent or opaque regions, and some completely
transparent</p>

<p>What you should do: Alpha testing with alpha blending</p>
