<h1>Multi-Texturing Pipeline</h1>

<p>At a high level, multi-texturing is the use of more than one texture
simultaneously on the same set of polygons. By combining the multiple textures
in different ways, subtle or striking effects can be created. These effects
include (but are not limited to) pseudo-lighting effects, slide and movie
projector effects, specular highlights, reflective and glossy surfaces,
shadows, and overlaid details. There are two basic forms of multi-textures in
Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in-static multi-textures and projected multi-textures. An
easy way to understand the difference between the two is by a simple physical
analogy. Static multi-textures represent surface properties of the objects to
which they are attached, while projected multi-textures represent spatial
phenomena such as the reflected environment, or a shaft of light coming from a
window in the scene.</p>

<p>The basic technical distinction between the two classes is equally simple.
Static multi-textures are attached as a rendering property to a group of
objects, and are mapped using texture coordinates defined in those objects.
Projected multi-textures are applied to a set of objects via a light-like
scoping mechanism and are mapped to the geometry via dynamically generated
texture coordinates that are computed inside the low-level render.</p>

<h2>The Texture Application Pipeline in Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in</h2>

<p>The texture application pipeline (or just "texture pipeline") defines how
the full set of multi-textures is applied to a polygon. The following diagram
details how each texture is applied to the results of the previous
multi-texturing operations. The pipeline starts at the top and flows to the
bottom.</p>
