<h1>PhysX Fluids and Max</h1>

<p>Gamebryo supports the conversion of Gamebryo particle 
 systems into PhysX fluid systems to be simulated on PhysX hardware. Any 
 Max &quot;PCloud&quot; particle system can be converted into a fluid system. 
 The rendering-related properties, such as particle properties, particle animations, 
 shading etc. are all used to render the fluid particles. Any parameters 
 related to the motion of the particles (gravity, wind fields, etc.) are 
 all ignored.</p>

<h2>Fluid Emitters</h2>

<p>Fluid emitters are automatically created out of the 
 PCloud particle system emitter. The emission rate, particle lifetime and 
 emission velocity are all respected, but other emission properties are 
 not. </p>

<p>All fluid emitters are planar polygonal shapes that 
 lie in the local X-Y plane of the particle system emitter and emit in 
 the positive Z direction. The shape, rectangular or elliptical, is based 
 on the PCloud emitter shape (box, cylinder or sphere). </p>

<p>To attach an emitter to a PhysX actor, link it as a 
 child of the actor in Max. The export process will automatically associate 
 the emitter with the actor. </p>

<h2>Exporting Fluids</h2>

<p>The conversion to PhysX fluids is done by the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor</a> tool plug-in when the &quot;Convert to PhysX Fluids&quot; 
 options are checked. All of the other content in the scene is also prepared 
 for use with fluids. Specifically: </p>

<ul>
	
	<li>All static physics-enabled 
 objects are exported as mesh shapes, and all mesh shapes are exported 
 as static actors, because this is the only supported arrangement for static 
 geometry in a fluid simulation. </li>
	
	<li>Convex shapes must 
 have fewer then 32 faces when converted to convex geometry for hardware, 
 so you must significantly reduce the number of subdivisions for spheres, 
 capsules, etc that are non-uniformly scaled. If the fluid is intended 
 to lie on the surface, then you must also use these low tessellations 
 for the rendered shape, or the fluid will appear to move strangely over 
 the surface.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you plan on merging scenes into one simulation at 
 run-time, these limitations on collision shapes must apply in all the 
 scenes that will be merged.</p>
