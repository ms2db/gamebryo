<h1>LOD Utility</h1>

<p>This MAXScript utility was designed to replace the 3ds Max LOD utility for
Gamebryo users. The settings for this utility are much more intuitive and match
Gamebryo implementation.</p>

            value in parentheses is the distance from the camera in world units
            that this object first becomes visible. The object disappears from

            results. The object is updated on a regular basis, but rapid
            movement will not produce valid switches in LOD until the utility
            has a chance to update. Orthographic views like Top, Bottom, Left,
            Right, Front, and Back do not work with the LOD preview since they
            have no real perspective on the object.</td>
