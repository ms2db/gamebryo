<h1>Alpha Testing</h1>

<p>Alpha testing is a method for controlling which pixels 
 are drawn and which are not. Alpha testing uses the alpha channel of the 
 texture to determine whether or not to draw a pixel. The alpha value of 
 each pixel is compared to a reference value defined by you. If the pixel 
 passes the test it is drawn (possibly alpha blended) into the scene. If 
 it does not pass then it is simply not drawn. Full back-to-front sorting 
 may be required for objects with semi-transparent, alpha blended regions. 
 However, in general, alpha testing's characteristics only require that 
 everything opaque be drawn before anything transparent. This sort is much 
 quicker than the full back-to-front sort required by alpha blending. As 
 a final note, both the function that compares the pixel's alpha value 
 to the reference value and the reference value itself are adjustable by 
 you. By default, pixels are drawn into the back buffer if their alpha 
 values are greater than the reference value.</p>

				<p class="FigureCaption">Alpha Testing sub-panel</p>
    </div> 

<p>The Alpha Testing 
 sub-panel allows the user to set the alpha testing parameters. The &quot;On&quot; 
 checkbox turns alpha testing on. The &quot;Test Ref&quot; parameter sets 
 the threshold while the &quot;Test Mode&quot; sets the comparison that 
 is used between each pixel and the threshold value. The &quot;Test Ref&quot; 
 value ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (completely opaque).</p>

<p>The &quot;Test Mode&quot; can be one 
 of: ALWAYS, LESS, EQUAL, LESSEQUAL, GREATER, NOTEQUAL, GREATEREQUAL, or 
 NEVER. In ALWAYS mode every pixel is alpha blended into the framebuffer 
 while in NEVER mode no pixels are ever written. In LESS and LESSEQUAL 
 modes the pixels are blended if their alpha value is less than or less-than-or-equal-to 
 the threshold value. GREATER and GREATEREQUAL are the modes you typically 
 use and blend the pixels into the framebuffer if their alpha value is 
 greater than or greater-than-or-equal-to the threshold value. Finally, 
 EQUAL and NOTEQUAL blend the pixel into the framebuffer if the alpha value 
 is equal or not equal to the threshold value, respectively. </p>

<p>The &quot;NoSorter&quot; 
 checkbox forces the alpha sorting system to ignore objects shaded by this 
 material. This behavior is useful if, due to the structure of the scene, 
 you know objects with this material do not need to be sorted to have their 
 transparency look correct. An example of this idea is a partially transparent 
 sky dome. It can always be drawn first and does not need to be sorted. 
 Another example would be an object that has no semi-transparent regions, 
 only opaque and completely transparent regions. This object needs to be 
 drawn after all the opaque objects, but does not need full-sorting, so 
 selecting &quot;NoSorter&quot; in this case is appropriate. Examples of 
 how to use all the parameters of alpha testing are given in the &quot;Common 
 Uses and Examples of the Gamebryo Shader&quot; section.</p>
