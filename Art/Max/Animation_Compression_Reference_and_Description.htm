<h1>Animation Compression Reference and Description</h1>

<h2>Compression Utility</h2>

<p>This utility provides the artist with the ability to edit the
compression settings on a per-actor, per-sequence, per-object, or
per-sequence and object level.</p>

<h4>Global Compression Settings</h4>

<p>This panel gives the compression settings for the current
actor root. These settings will be used for every object in every
sequence unless otherwise specified.</p>

<h4>Selection Control</h4>

<p>In some cases, it may be necessary to override the global
behavior of the compression settings. This may be due to
unacceptable compression in the hierarchy or due to tighter
memory needs on commonly used sequences. The Selection Control
group provides all of the UI necessary to override the global
behavior.</p>

            compression ratio higher in quality than its

            compression ratio higher in quality than its children
            for the run cycle, but the idle animations will work
