<h1>Animation Manager Reference and Description</h1>

<h2>Actors Panel</h2>

<p>This panel gives information about the actor root for 
 this animation. This actor root should be an object at the top of the 
 hierarchy containing all of the animations that you want to be
 extracted into kf files. For biped characters, this is usually the 
 Bip01 or Root bone.</p>

            this is rarely the case for game development, you
            will usually only have one entry in this panel. The
            dropdown list indicates all of the known actors in
            the scene. Selecting from this list will set the
            current Actor Root for this plug-in. It was included
            in case you have a character that rides a horse,
            dragon, etc or when you need to actors to be in
            sync.</td>

            <td>Add</td>

            <td>Select a node that you want to use as an actor

            node.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Accumulation Root</td>

            <td>View the name of the
            current Accumulation Root of the actor (usually the
            Actor Root). You can use this field if you are
            accumulating animations. This is where all
            accumulated translations, scales, and rotations are
            applied. An example of this idea would be a walking
            forward animation in which the character actually
            translates in space. Setting the Bip01 to be the
            Accumulation Root will allow the character to
            continue to translate forward without the skip back
            to the translation specified by the first key when
            the animation loops.<br>
            <br>
            When exported, the Accumulation Root is divided into
            two nodes. One node stores the animation that needs
            to be accumulated, while the other stores the
            animation that does not get accumulated. Because this
            divide is made, it is important that your
            accumulation root does not use a non-standard
            animation controller such as a path controller.
            Additionally, the accumulation root should not be a
            bone influencing a skinned mesh. Since the exported
            nodes animations are split between two nodes, you may
            see serious skinning artifacts.</td>

<h2>Active Sequence Panel</h2>

<p>This panel is the meat of the Gamebryo Animation Utility. 
 This panel is where you set the individual animation sequences of your 
 actors.</p>

                <div class="NDLTDNote">
                    <span class="NDLTableNote">Tip: </span>You can
                    jump between animations very easily by using
                    the Next and Previous buttons in combination
                    with the Make Time Fit button. Previewing
                    multiple animations is easy with this
                    addition.
                </div>If you are using morphs, the first frame of
                the time slider indicates the state of the base
                mesh, so changing the current animation time
                range can cause undesirable results upon export
                unless you set your time back to include that
                first frame. This capability is meant as a
                preview tool only.

<h2>Active Layer Panel</h2>

<p>    This panel gives information about the various 
 Layer Roots of the current Actor Root. Layer Roots are meant to allow 
 flexibility in mixing animations. For instance, you could mix and match 
 a walk animation and an arm wave animation using layer roots. One Layer 
 Root would control the arm and another Layer Root would control the hips.</p>
