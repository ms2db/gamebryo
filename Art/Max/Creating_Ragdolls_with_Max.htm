<h1>Creating Rag-dolls with Max</h1>

<p>Creating a ragdoll for a character is simply placing contstraints for each joint and rigid 
bodies for each bone that match the shape and movement behavior for each joint. Converting a 
character rig into a ragdoll rig is done with the PhysX Max Plug-in so the process is not 
documented here. However, this page does cover a few tips that help get the best results with
ragdolls when converting to Gamebryo.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use dynamic actors for characters that will be rag-dolls when used with the
    Gamebryo animation system. Kinematic actors will continue to be kinematic when the
    rag-doll is activated in Gamebryo.</li>

    <li>You can use any kind of PhysX shape for the rigid-bodies, including convex shapes or even
    groups of shapes. Capsules, spheres or boxes will be faster, but are less useful for matching
    complex characters.</li>

    <li>The rigid bodies should have masses that are all about the same, say within a factor of ten
    (if the smallest mass is 1, the largest is 10). It is easier to enforce this if you explicitly
    set the masses of the bodies and do not use the density. Performance is also improved if the
    heaviest bones are near the root of the character with lower masses as you move toward the
    limbs.</li>

    <li>Rag-dolls are a situation in which the <em>solver iteration count</em> may need to be
    increased on the dynamic actors. This is done with the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
    "Gamebryo_Rigid_Body_Extras_with_Max.htm">NiPhysXActorIterations</a></span> User Prop.</li>

    <li>You must use PhysX joints and limits due to a limitation in the Gamebryo export process.
    You cannot use Reactor joints.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Physics and the Animation Manager</h2>

<p>When creating animation sequences for a character using <a href=
"Introduction_!Animation_Manager.htm">Gamebryo's Animation Manager,</a> you can create an
additional sequence for the physics system to control. In fact, you can create several sequences if
you would like sub-portions of the character to be physically controlled (say just an arm or a
leg). In the <a href=
"../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_PhysX_in_Animation_Tool.htm">Gamebryo Animation
Tool</a> you can then specify the sequences as physical and set up transitions and blends with
regular animation.</p>

<p>When the sequence is made physical, the translation and scale on the character during that
sequence will be taken over by physics. It is important that the sequences intended for physical
control be set to Loop in the Animation Manager. The duration of the sequence controls how long it
will play before looping while viewing transitions in Animation Tool. There must not be any scale
on the "Accumulation Root" of the character.</p>

<p>When exporting a model for use with Animation Tool we strongly recommend checking the "Initial
States from Sequences" box in the <a href="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX
Extractor</a> tool plug-in.</p>

<h2>Addressing Jitter</h2>

<p>When you preview your rag-doll, it may jitter. There are several ways to address this problem
but they must be implemented at run-time because the required actor properties are not exposed by
the Max plug-in. The PhysX PhysX developer site has help on solving rag-doll jitter problems.</p>
