<h1>Projected Shadow Maps</h1>

<p>Projected shadow maps are very similar to projected light maps except that
when projected shadow maps overlap they become darker. This behavior makes for
more realistic shadow-to-shadow interaction. Like light maps, projected shadow
maps come in both perspective and parallel varieties (for limits specified on
those lights, please see the section on Projected Light Maps).</p>

<p>They are specified by placing an image in the Shadow Map slot of a Direct or
Spot light.</p>

<p>Using a Direct light will result in a parallel projection, while using a
Spot light will result in a perspective projection.</p>

<p>Projected shadow maps always project a static texture. In order to have a
projected texture effect that changes shape to match a shadow caster, either
enable dynamic shadow casting on a light or have a programmer regenerate the
projected shadow map.</p>

<p>In using projected textures, you may discover an unexpected (and perhaps
undesirable) side effect: parallel and perspective projected texture
projections are bi-directional. That is, the textures are projected infinitely
in both directions. For example, a projected spotlight effect that is applied
to an entire room will produce a circle of light on two walls-the wall that is
directly in front of the projection, and the wall that is directly behind it.
Gamebryo does support "clipped" projected textures. In order to enable
clipping, a user must add "NiClipPlane = true" to the User Property buffer of
the light. This will add a clipping plane behind the light. Note that enabling
this feature may decrease performance as additional work must be done to clip
the texture.</p>

<h2>Shadow Maps vs. Light Maps</h2>

<p>Projected shadow maps and projected light maps will give identical results
in situations where they are being used with only a base texture and vertex
lighting. They will only appear different when used with additional
multi-texture effects (esp. other projected shadow maps).</p>
