<h1>Introduction to Texturing</h1>

<p>Gamebryo's texturing system includes a wide range of 
 multitexture, projected texture, dynamic texture, and rendered texture 
 effects. Multiple textures per polygon are supported, and the interfaces 
 to advanced texturing features such as rendered textures are platform-independent. 
 </p>

<p>This document details the object texturing system in 
 Gamebryo. It describes in detail the way texturing works and how it can 
 be configured by Gamebryo applications. Numerous texturing effects are 
 described that can be achieved with the Gamebryo standard material, from 
 simple single texturing to effects requiring multiple projected textures 
 per object. Applications can also use custom materials to enable additional, 
 specific effects as well.</p>

<p>The document does not describe the limitations of particular 
 renderers with respect to texturing effects. Renderer-specific limitations 
 and missing features are described in the renderer document pertaining 
 to the particular renderer class (e.g. the Gamebryo <a href="../../Reference/NiDX9Renderer/Introduction_to_the_DX9Renderer.htm">NiDX9Renderer</a> 
 documentation). All users of Gamebryo are strongly urged to read the renderer 
 documentation pertaining to any renderers they intend to use. Not all 
 renderers support all of the effects described below, and not all renderers 
 that support a given feature can do so on all end-user machine configurations.</p>

<p>Note that this information is designed to aid developers 
 in understanding the texturing system. In most applications, much (or 
 most) of the burden of texturing objects will be handled automatically 
 by the content export plug-ins such as the Gamebryo 3ds max Plug-in or 
 the Gamebryo Maya Plug-in. However, it is very useful for developers to 
 understand how the textures are specified in Gamebryo.</p>
