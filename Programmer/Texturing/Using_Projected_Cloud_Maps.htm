<h1>Using Projected Cloud Maps</h1>

<h2>Effect</h2>

<p>A cloud map is a projected effect that causes an entire 
 scene to appear to be in varying levels of shadow both spatially and temporally, 
 as if a layer of clouds is moving high above the scene. Note that this 
 effect does not render the clouds themselves, only the shadowed effect 
 produced by the interference of the clouds with the light from the sun.</p>

<h2>Filter</h2>

<p>Any filter is possible, but <span class="NDLSystemFont">BILERP</span> or a <span class="NDLSystemFont">BILERP-</span>ed mipmap mode 
 is recommended to avoid blockiness.</p>

<h2>Clamping</h2>

<p>Cloud maps should use <span class="NDLSystemFont">WRAP_S_WRAP_T</span> mode, 
 as the cloud cover will cover the entire scene and can safely repeat several 
 times over the scene. Also, the wrapping makes it safe to "slide" 
 the texture coordinates infinitely over time to make the clouds move over 
 the scene.</p>

<h2>Effect mode</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">PROJECTED_LIGHT</span>&mdash;this is an infinite form of projected lighting.</p>

<h2>Texture coordinate mode</h2>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">WORLD_PARALLEL</span>&mdash;this effect represents light from the sun, which is essentially an infinite, 
 parallel source.</p>

<h2>Image</h2>

<p>The application should create an image containing large-scale 
 cloud formations, such as those that can be created using common filters 
 in most commercial image editing applications. The cloud image should 
 be dark at cloud positions and bright for clear sky. A classic blue-and-white 
 cloud image will produce the reverse of the desired effect. Each pixel 
 in the image represents the color and intensity of the light that is shining 
 through the clouds at that point. The texture image should also be toroidal&mdash;that is, the left and right edges should match, and the top and bottom 
 edges should match. If this is not the case, the effect will have jarring 
 seams at the edge of each texture repeat.</p>

<h2>Transforms</h2>

<p>The transforms are as follows, where:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>The cloud texture will 
 repeat at a period equal to a unit length in the model space of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>. 
 In other words, if the scale of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span> 
 is S, the cloud pattern will repeat once over each S x S sized block in 
 world space.</li>
	
	<li>The cloud layer is 
 assumed to be perpendicular to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>'s 
 model-space Y vector. In other words, the model-space Y vector is the 
 "up" vector.</li>
	
	<li>The cloud layer's U 
 direction maps to the model-space X vector of the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiTextureEffect</span>.</li>
	
	<li>The direction of the 
 sun/moonlight is the unit-vector D.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>In order to make the clouds appear to move over time, 
 applications may change the T vector over time to "slide" the 
 texture in the sky. This can make the effect seem more "stormy".</p>

<p>In order to show the passing of the time of day, rotate 
 the D vector over time. Do not rotate the effect itself, as that will 
 cause the plane of the clouds to rotate, which is not the desired effect.</p>

<p>For an even stronger effect, two different cloud map 
 effects may be used in conjunction. Each of the two cloud maps should 
 move at different speeds and have different images. In this case, there 
 appear to be multiple layers of clouds at different altitudes. The effect 
 can appear quite complex. If more than one cloud map is used at once, 
 it is better to use <span class="NDLSystemFont">SHADOW_MAP</span> 
 mode, to make each layer of clouds darken the scene more.</p>
