<h1>Basic Requirements for NiTexture objects</h1>

<p>There are some basic requirements for all textures in 
 Gamebryo. Some of the more significant requirements are listed below:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>Textures in Gamebryo 
 can be two-dimensional or cube maps. One-dimensional textures may be simulated 
 using a 1xN texture. </li>
	
	<li>The height and width 
 of a two-dimensional texture need not be square.</li>
	
	<li>Mipmaps are supported 
 for all texture types.</li>
	
	<li>It may be desirable 
 to use non-power-of-two pixel dimensions in some cases, e.g., for full-screen 
 splash screens, or when using the backbuffer as a rendered texture. Gamebryo 
 supports non-power-of-two texture dimensions on hardware that supports 
 them. Refer to the specific renderer documentation for information about 
 renderer support for non-power-of-two textures.</li>
	
	<li>It is best to use power-of-two 
 texture sizes on models as the only way to <em>guarantee</em> compatibility 
 across all platforms is to support the lowest common requirement, which 
 in this case corresponds to a requirement for power-of-two texture dimensions.</li>
	
	<li>Palettized cube maps 
 are not supported..</li>
	
	<li>Palettized, Palettized 
 with alpha palette entries, RGB, RGBA and DX compressed textures are supported 
 on some or all platforms. Note that support for palettized textures is 
 decreasing in modern hardware. Users should prefer compressed textures. 
 </li>
	
	<li>Luminance and Luminance/Alpha 
 textures are not supported. </li>
	
	<li>Bump map formats are 
 supported on some platforms (only as a static multitexture). </li>
	
	<li>Volume textures are 
 not directly supported by Gamebryo but can be used in some renderers via 
 specialized interfaces.</li>
	
	<li>"Colorkey" 
 or "Chromakey" textures are not supported in Gamebryo. Applications 
 should use alpha testing and alpha blending for this functionality. </li>
</ul>
