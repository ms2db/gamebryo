<h1>Bump Map</h1>

<p>The Bump Map is a special format map that represents the
micro-scale bumpiness and glossiness of the surface being
textured. The Bump map can be used with an environment map to
create specular bump mapping or can be used alone to create
diffuse bump mapping. Gamebryo's standard material only supports
the use of bump maps with environment maps, but custom shaders
can also support the latter usage. There are two basic forms of
specular Bump Maps: with and without Luminance (or Luma)
channels. If present, the Luma channel represents the
monochromatic glossiness of the surface. It is exactly equivalent
to the Gloss Map above, but only allows attenuation of the
environment map, not tinting.</p>

<p>The effect of the specular Bump Map itself is complex. An
artist generates an RGB map (or RGBA if they wish to include a
Luma channel) where the color channels (only red is used; green
and blue are normally set equal to the red, forming a grayscale
image) represent a height field&mdash;brighter means higher,
darker means lower. The image converter converts this into the
required format, and, when applied, the slope of the bumps in the
bump map are used to shift the environment map on a per-pixel
basis, making the surface appear to have subtle bumps in it.
Depending on the overall "texture" of the Bump Map, the surface
can be made to have any type of look&mdash;hammered metal,
brushed aluminum, gritty stone, and so on.</p>

<p>Note also that if a bump map and a gloss map are both
supplied, the hardware will use both if the appropriate level of
multitexturing is supported. If the hardware cannot support all
three textures in conjunction, the bump map will take priority
over the gloss map on hardware that supports bump mapping.</p>

<p>Bump maps can also be used to create diffuse bump mapping
effects. Because the implementation of diffuse bump mapping can
vary from renderer to renderer, refer to the renderer
documentation for more details about diffuse bump maps.</p>

<p>Because of the additional settings required by Bump Maps, the
Bump Map slot in an <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturingProperty.htm">NiTexturingProperty</a></span>
does not use the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturingProperty_Map.htm">NiTexturingProperty::Map</a></span>
objects used by other static multitextures, but rather an
<span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/NiMain/NiTexturingProperty_BumpMap.htm">NiTexturingProperty::BumpMap</a></span>
object, which includes the extra settings. This use of the
<span class="NDLSystemFont">BumpMap</span> object is enforced by
the interfaces.</p>
