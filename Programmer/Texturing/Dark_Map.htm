<h1>Dark Map</h1>

<p>A Dark Map is an RGB map that defines the static environmental 
 lighting incident on a surface. A Dark Map modulates the Base Map at each 
 pixel. Its name comes from the fact the Map, assuming a color range of 
 [0, 1], can only darken the Base Map&mdash;white pixels in the Dark Map pass 
 the Base Map through unchanged, while any darker or tinted sections of 
 the Dark Map will darken or tint the Base Map. Texture formats that can 
 represent values beyond 1 will brighten the surface.</p>

<p>A common use of this form of <span class="NDLSystemFont">Map</span> 
 is to apply it with a Base Map that wraps many times over the object. 
 Without any Dark Map, this Base Map would look monotonous. However, using 
 a complex Dark Map texture that wraps only once over the entire surface 
 of the object can make it difficult to realize that the Base Map is actually 
 repeated. In this way, a low-resolution Base Map (say 128x128) repeated 
 16 times over a surface mated with a 32x32 Dark Map, repeated once over 
 the surface can simulate a non-repeating texture that appears to be a 
 2048x2048 texture (i.e. 128 times 16). Also, both the Dark Map and the 
 Base Map may be used with other maps, giving a large range of texturing 
 possibilities.</p>

<p>A given surface may have only one Dark Map at a time. 
 However, there are projected multitexturing effects that allow effects 
 similar to multiple Dark Maps. These techniques are described below in 
 the section on Projected Multitexturing; specifically the section describing 
 projected lights and shadows.</p>
