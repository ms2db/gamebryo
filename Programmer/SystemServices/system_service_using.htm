<h1>Using system services</h1>

<p>System services are created as a subclass of <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href=
"../../Reference/efd/efd__ISystemService.htm">efd::ISystemService</a></span>. Topics in this section
describe how to create, modify, and delete a system service. This includes the methods you should
override and registering the service with the service manager.</p>

<p>The interaction between system services can take several different forms. You can get access
directly to another system service by calling methods on the Service Manager. After you have a
reference to the other system service, you can make calls to any public methods on that service.
This approach implies a tight coupling between the two services.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can interact with other system services by sending messages to them via the
Message Service. By using the message system to create interactions between services, you reduce the
coupling between the services. This makes it possible to create optional system services that
provide additional or enhanced functionality. It also lets you add and remove these services as
necessary.</p>

<p>Once you've created a system service, register it with the Service Manager and assign it a
priority. After all system services and other resources are allocated and regsitered, call "<span
class="NDLSystemFont">Run</span>" on the Service Manager to start ticking the application. This
method will run until <span class="NDLSystemFont">ServiceManager::Shutdown</span> is eventually
called.</p>
