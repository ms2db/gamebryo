<h1>Gamebryo-PhysX Known Issues and Limitations </h1>

<p>This page documents the known programming-related issues
 and limitations with both the Gamebryo-PhysX integration and issues with
 the currently supported NVIDIA PhysX&trade; SDK that are poorly documented and
 arise frequently when working with Gamebryo-PhysX. For a more complete
 and updated list of known PhysX issues, please use the <a href="../../Programmer/NiPhysX/NVIDIA_PhysX_Resources.htm#Main_NVIDIA_PhysX_Web_Page">NVIDIA
 PhysX developer site</a>. </p>



<p class="NDLRefHead2">Gamebryo-PhysX Known Issues and Limitations </p>

<ul>

	<li>Gamebryo only supports
 NVIDIA PhysX&trade; version 2.8.3. The following specific builds have been tested.<ul>
            <li>PC - 2.8.3.21</li>
            <li>Xbox 360 - 2.8.3.34</li>
            <li>PS3 - 2.8.3 Build B1</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

	<li>Gamebryo does not explicitly
 support PhysX update rates that are higher than the application frame
 rate (more than one call to <span class="NDLSystemFont">Simulate</span>
 per frame). This could be implemented using Gamebryo's threading support,
 but it is not provided as part of core functionality. </li>

	<li>Not all PhysX content
 is streamable. Wheel shapes, terrain, non-D6 joints and continuous collision
 detection structures are the most significant missing features. Also,
 applications must arrange streaming of <span class="NDLSystemFont">userData</span>,
 because Gamebryo does not know what the pointer contains.</li>

	<li>The classes that manage
 accumulation, derived from the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXAccumRigidBodyDest.htm">NiPhysXAccumRigidBodyDest</a></span>
 class, do not support scaling transformations applied to the Accumulation
 Root node or the Non-Accumulation node.</li>

	<li>The <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a
 href="../../Reference/NiPhysX/NiPhysXSequenceManager.htm">NiPhysXSequenceManager::RemoveSequence</a></span>
 function does not undo all the changes that were made when the sequence
 was added. See the class documentation for details.</li>
    <li>Gamebryo and PhysX both expose particle lifespan settings; behavior is undefined
        when these do not match. In particular, color keying depends on the Gamebryo
        setting, while observed particle lifetime depends on the PhysX setting. </li>

        <li>The <a href="The_NiPhysXFluid_System.htm">NiPhysXFluid</a>
        system does not expose particle velocities, so any particle
        alignment settings that use velocity will fail. Use only non-velocity data to
        define particle orientations.</li>
</ul>

<p class="NDLRefHead2">PhysX 2.8.3 Known Issues and Limitations </p>

<ul>

	<li>PhysX 2.8.3 does not activate ON_ENTER callbacks when a trigger is created
        inside a trigger it would normally interact with, nor ON_LEAVE callbacks when a
        trigger is destroyed inside a trigger it would normally interact with. One
        workaround for getting these events is to create triggers at a point outside
        your scene and move them to the desired location, and similarly to move them
        outside your scene before destroying them.</li>
    <li>Fluids simulated on
 consoles crash on the first simulation step after NxFluid::removeAllParticles.
 Gamebryo has disabled this functionality for console fluid simulation,
 so console fluid systems cannot be reset.</li>

	<li>Fluids simulation in
 PhysX 2.8.3 only supports mesh-based static shapes. Any shape can be used
 for dynamic objects. Gamebryo is aware of this limitation in its art pipeline
 and will warn during export from the art tools. However, applications
 creating content in software must be aware of this limitation.</li>

	<li>On PS3, triggers fail to activate when the actor is created in a
	non-default compartment.
	</li>

	<li>On Win32, the computer may lock up or otherwise fail when multiple threads
	try to simultaneously initialize the SDK. We experienced this problem when initializing
	the SDK during multi-threaded build steps.
	</li>
</ul>
