<h1>Asset Infrastructure Limitations</h1>

<p>It is important to recognize that the Asset Runtime Service
provides just one pillar of the full asset management system that
you will want to employ in any large project. A full asset
management solution will also include project-specific processes
and developer tools that can be supported by, but are not
provided by, the existing asset infrastructure.</p>

<h3>Limitations on the types of files that can be rapidly iterated</h3>

<ul>
    <li>With few exceptions, you can only rapidly iterate on 'baked' art assets
    that are located and loaded directly.  For example, changing only a source art .max or
    .mb file does not automatically cause a re-export to NIF, and will not be caught.  If
    the source art file is exported to NIF after being saved, then it will be caught and
    reloaded.</li>

    <li>If you delete and then add a file with the same name as
    the deleted file, you will experience problems with rapid
    iteration. The Asset Runtime Service considers the newly
    added file to be a different asset entirely. This means that
    any entities that use the deleted file will not be updated.
    Rather than deleting and adding, we recommend that you change
    assets in place by exporting them.</li>

    <li>Rapid iteration on shaders is not supported.</li>
</ul>
