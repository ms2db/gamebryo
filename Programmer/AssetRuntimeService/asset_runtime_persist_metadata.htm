<h1>Persisting Your Asset Metadata</h1>

                Persisted metadata is an under-development
                feature that is being provided as an early
                preview. As such, it is not a supported part of
                Gamebryo LightSpeed. There are known bugs related to this
                feature which will require engineering work if
                you wish to use this ability. The following
                documentation describes the intended operation of
                this feature, but it is all subject to significant
                changes in future product versions.

<p>You can choose to recompute the metadata for your assets on
the fly, or generate it once and persist it. Persistent metadata
is required to provide relocatability of asset files while
avoiding having to fix up references to the assets after they are
moved. The Asset Runtime Service provides location independence as
long as the metadata is kept consistent using either persistence
or strict asset file organization rules. Persisting the metadata
allows for much more freedom to dynamically refactor your asset
web and is recommended for larger projects. On the other hand,
regenerating the metadata on the fly requires less configuration
management and is recommended for smaller projects and leaves the
option open for switching to persistence later.</p>

<p>The metadata that is required by the Asset Runtime Service may
be automatically generated from the assets alone, or it may be
obtained from source metadata files that have been previously
created. Any source metadata that exists will appear throughout
the asset web directories in sub-directories named
"<span class="NDLSystemFont">asset-src-metadata/</span>". These sub-directories will contain one file with a <span class="NDLSystemFont">.nt</span> extension for each asset in its parent
directory that needs source metadata. The <span class="NDLSystemFont">*.nt</span> files may include
persistent Id values that have been previously associated with
the asset. They may also include tag or property values that have
been created for the asset through some asset management tool.
The metadata in these files is merged with all other generated
metadata when the Asset Controller application is run.</p>

<p>Persisted metadata is not required for all projects, and its
default use is controlled project-wide by settings in the
configuration files that are stored in the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config</span>
directory. In particular, small projects with few assets and
little need to share between projects or reorganize directory
structure will not need persisted metadata. Larger projects with
tens of thousands of assets and more complicated tagging or
sharing requirements should use persisted metadata to tap these
more sophisticated features.</p>

<h2>Persistent Logical Asset Ids</h2>

<p>One common use case for persisting metadata is to allow
Globally Unique ID values (GUIDs) to be created as the Logical
Asset Id for new assets. If these Ids are persisted and used
consistently by all the developers, then each asset becomes
uniquely identifiable and locatable in the asset web, regardless
of where it is stored. Thus, using this feature would allow you
to reorganize your asset directories without breaking the
references to asset files that you have created in your content.
Also, assets would be freely moved between projects without any
ambiguity as to what asset they represent or where they need to
be stored in the directory tree.</p>

<p>Enabling Persistent Logical Asset Id's requires you to add
some additional steps to your process. The source metadata files
that will now be created by the Asset Controller will need to be
preserved and transferred among all the developers. Normally,
this is best done by committing the files to your revision
control system. Also, any copy/move/removal of the asset file must be
coupled with a copy/move/removal of the metadata file that is associated
with the asset, so your process will need to guarantee that this
occurs. Metadata files for a given asset file are easily
identifiable. For example:</p>

<pre>
Asset: <em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/MyAwesomeGame/Media/Characters/ogre.nif
Metadata: <em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/MyAwesomeGame/Media/Characters/asset-src-metadata/ogre.nif_.nt
</pre>

<p>To enable automatic management of persistent logical
asset ids by the Asset Controller, you simply need to enable the
feature in <span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>&lt;Asset Web Root Directory&gt;</em>/asset-web-config/LogicalIdTagger.ini</span>.
Set the value of "<span class="NDLSystemFont">PersistentIds =
True</span>".</p>
