<h1>Troubleshooting the Asset Infrastructure</h1>

<h2>Locating Assets</h2>

<p>One common class of problems that you will likely troubleshoot
occurs when your game is unable to locate the assets that it
needs. This can manifest itself as either not finding
<span class="NDLGUILabel">any assets</span> or as not being able
to find some of the assets.</p>

<p>The more common case is not being able to find any of the
assets due to configuration problems with the Asset Runtime
Service. When this occurs, it will be evident when your game
fails to load whichever Block file you have specified for it.
When the game fails to locate the block, none of the entities it
contains get instanced and no behaviors are run. You will then be
faced with the sad reality of a blank screen.</p>

<h3>Blank Screen</h3>

<p>If you encounter such a blank screen, you can confirm this
issue by searching the game log file for asset lookup failures.
Search the log for entries with <span class="NDLGUILabel">"found
no assets that matched URI"</span>. If you encounter such a log
entry with the Asset Id of your initial block file, then it is
not being found.</p>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
    <tbody>
        <tr align="left">
            <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD">
                <p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>

                <div class="NDLNote">
                    Make sure you turn your log level high enough
                    for the game to log the information you are
                    looking for. You can do that by setting the
                    following in your config file:

                    <p>[Log.Filters]<br>
                    0 = UptoErr3 | UptoLvl2</p>
                </div>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The two most likely causes of not finding any assets in the
game are a wrong path specified for the asset's <em>&lt;Asset Web
Root Directory&gt;</em>, or pointing to a proper directory which
does not contain the necessary metadata.</p>

<ul>
    <li>You can double check this by looking in the game's log
    for the statement <span class=
    "NDLGUILabel">"AssetConfigService::OnInit"</span>, since this
    is the method call that configures the correct path. If the
    path does not match where your assets are stored, then you
    have found the problem.</li>

<li>If the path looks ok, then your next step should be to
browse the path and ensure that it contains a sub-directory at the top
level called <span class="NDLGUILabel">asset-web-metadata</span>. Inside this directory should
be a couple dozen (or more) files with <span class="NDLSystemFont">.nt</span> extensions that were
produced by the Asset Controller either during your build, or when you
launched Toolbench and opened your game solution. For additional
information, see <a
 href="asset_runtime_reqs.htm">Requirements for Working with the Asset Infrastructure</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Missing Assets</h3>

<p>You may run into a problem where an asset that you have
recently added cannot be linked to from Toolbench when you select
the asset in the file picker. Again, this problem is indicated by
a Framework log message containing <span class=
"NDLGUILabel">"found no assets that matched URI"</span>. This
would result in Toolbench displaying a property value of "Invalid
Asset" where your asset's name should appear. If this happens, it
probably means that the asset metadata has gotten out-of-sync
with the asset files you recently added. To correct this, you
should exit Toolbench, delete all of the files from <span class=
"NDLGUILabel">&lt;ContentRootDirectory&gt;/asset-web-metadata/</span>
and then restart Toolbench.</p>

<p>Another common issue is that an apparently random subset of
the assets needed by your game are not being found. This can
point to a number of different possible problems that you will
need to investigate.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The asset URI is wrong. The asset exists, but the Id that
    you are trying to use is not correct. This could be a
    typographical error.</li>

    <li>The asset does not have the expected metadata/tagging.
    You may have the correct URI, but the metadata does not
    reflect this information for the particular asset(s).</li>

    <li>The asset URI has become obsolete. Perhaps the URI would
    have found an asset in the past, but you have restructured
    your assets in such a way that it is no longer valid.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues are not always easy to diagnose. A good starting
point is to try the URI that is failing, and similar ones that you
think might be correct, using the Asset Controller. For more
information on how to do this, consult <a
 href="asset_runtime_cli_ref.htm">Asset Infrastructure Command Line Reference</a>.</p>
<h2>Loading Wrong Assets</h2>
<p>Another common issue you might confront is that your game is not
loading the correct assets, based on how you have configured things or
based on the particular platform under test (for multi-platform games).
 This could be a result of problems with your <span class="NDLGUILabel">tagging policy</span>, or
problems with adhering to the policy when the asset files were
organized. To troubleshoot these issues, verify that you are
following all of the procedures discussed in <a
 href="asset_runtime_platform_support.htm">Supporting Multiple Platforms</a>.</p>
<h2>Network Connectivity</h2>

<p>Network connectivity can be an issue any time you are using
Toolbench to edit your content or attempting to perform rapid
iteration work flows. For the system to function, network
communications are required between the Asset Controller,
Toolbench, and the game. If all parties are communicating, then
you should see a green icon in the task try for the Asset
Controller. Furthermore, inspecting the tool tip for the Asset
Controller should display the expected <span class=
"NDLGUILabel">number of connections</span>. If this is not
working, then one of the components is not configured correctly
for the connection. To troubleshoot these issues, verify that you
are following all of the procedures discussed in <a href=
"asset_runtime_config.htm">Configuring the Asset Runtime
Service.</a></p>
