<h1>Asset Infrastructure Overview</h1>

<p>The asset handling infrastructure in Gamebryo LightSpeed consists
of several systems that together manage the indexing of assets on disk,
the location of them at runtime, the loading of them into an application
and the reloading as assets change (Rapid Iteration).</p>

<p>The <a href="asset_locate_svcs_overview.htm">asset locating services</a>
provide a consistent framework for
naming, locating, and organizing the assets that comprise your
game's content. The services simplify game configuration by
enabling you to configure a single path that references the
location of the game content. Within this single path, the
services allow significant flexibility to tailor how the assets
are stored. This enables artists and programmers to establish
their own effective strategies for asset organization.</p>

<p>The Asset Locating Services make it easy to reconfigure asset
selection when you deploy your game on different platforms,
different locales, or any other type of variation that your
project requires. Furthermore, the services are a key ingredient
used for Gamebryo's rapid iteration functionality. The services
provide the change notification framework that allows updated
assets to be instantly incorporated into a game while it is
executing.</p>

<p>The <a href="asset_load_svcs_overview.htm">asset loading services</a>
provide a central runtime entry point for loading assets from disk,
including non-blocking background loading. This enables games to meet
the console manufacturer's technical requirements for a shipping game,
while also simplifying loading for applications.</p>

<p>The components of the asset infrastructure are incorporated into
asset editors to simplify selection, to allow externally edited content to be
recognized and to communicate changes with previewers and running
games. A shipping library is provided that optimizes asset
locating and loading skipping the indirection needed during
development. Running applications also incorporate the runtime to
perform location-independent loading, background loading, preemptive loading,
and to receive change notifications. Additional background tools are provided
to manage external changes to files and to maintain the optimized local asset
database.</p>
