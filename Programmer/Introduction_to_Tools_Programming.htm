<h1>Tools Programming: Introduction</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed ships with many powerful tools designed to
be extensible by a studio in order to meet the custom demands of
a particular project.</p>

<h3>Toolbench Customization</h3>

<p><a href="../Tools/Toolbench/tb_intro.htm">Toolbench</a> is the
application plug-in framework used as the foundation for many of
the tools that ship with Gamebryo LightSpeed. The following are
the major tools hosted with-in the Toolbench architecture.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href=
    "../Tools/EntityModelingTool/emt_intro.htm">Entity Modeling
    Tool</a></li>

    <li><a href="../Tools/WorldBuilder/wb_intro.htm">World
    Builder</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "../Tools/ScriptDebugger/efr_script_debugger_intro.htm">Script
    Debugger</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "../Tools/SimDebugger/sim_debugger_intro.htm">Simulation
    Debugger</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Toolbench is designed from the ground up to be completely
driven by plug-ins. Plug-ins are extensible by other plug-ins
through the use of an extension and extension point mechanism.
This mechanism provides the ability for plug-ins to define their
own contract with other plug-ins in the system without being
forced to rely on a common plug-in API. In fact, the tools listed
above are hosted by the Toolbench framework and consist of several different plug-ins.</p>

<p>In order to get started writing plug-ins for Toolbench, see
the <a href="Toolbench/tb_intro.htm">Toolbench Introduction</a>
section of the documentation.</p>

<h3>Tool Plug-in Framework</h3>

<p>In addition to the powerful exporter support for Max, Maya,
and XSI, Gamebryo LightSpeed also ships with a plug-in framework
specifically targeted at the art pipeline. When a scene is
exported from a DCC tool, the scene itself is passed through a
series of tool plug-ins. These tool plug-ins provide capabilities
such as processing geometry data, converting from one file format
to another, saving platform specific data, and so forth. See
<a href=
"../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/Available_Tool_Plug_ins.htm">this
list</a> all of the tool plug-ins that ship with Gamebryo
LightSpeed. To get started writing custom plug-ins for the tool
art pipeline, see <a href=
"../Art/Other/Introduction_to_the_Gamebryo_Tool_Plug_in_Framework.htm">
this introduction</a> to the tool framework.</p>
