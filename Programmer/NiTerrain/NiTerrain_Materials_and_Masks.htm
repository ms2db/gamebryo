<h1>
    NiTerrain Materials and Masks
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>The terrain engine allows materials to be painted on a terrain sector through the Toolbench 
  World Builder tools. This allows the terrain to be 'painted' to look like grass, rock, snow, sand, 
  and so on. Materials are used to define the look of a particular section of the terrain and can 
  specify additional user defined meta-data information (such as how a particular type of grass 
  should sound underfoot). Vertex and pixel shaders are automatically generated depending on the 
  texture map configuration for each material applied to the terrain. Each material may contain the 
  following specified types of textures:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Diffuse texture</li>
    <li>Detail texture</li>
    <li>Normal mapping texture</li>
    <li>Parallax mapping texture</li>
    <li>Distribution mask</li>
    <li>Specular texture</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Each of these textures are described in detail in the section on the use of textures in terrain
   materials.</p>
  
  <p>Materials may also store useful information to describe the material. This data can be used to 
  describe many things on the terrain. In particular, the following use cases have proven 
  useful:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Specifying certain materials as 'walkable' or not, such that queries to the terrain can 
    determine if a character can walk on that section of the terrain or not.</li>
    <li>Specifying physical properties of the terrain for physics simulations (see the PhysX terrain 
    integration).</li>
    <li>Specifying vegetation coverage information for instanced geometry.</li>
  </ul>
 
  <p>The application of meta data on the terrain is discussed in the corresponding section of this 
  documentation.</p>
  <h3>
    Naming Convention
  </h3>
  <p>It is worth noting, that the terrain engine documentation and code sometimes refers to both 
  'Materials' and 'Surfaces' interchangeably. Here, we make the distinction that the name 'surface' 
  is used when dealing with code and the runtime, whilst when dealing with tools and documentation, 
  the name 'material' is used though there is actually no difference in meaning intended and the 
  same objects are being referred to.</p>
  <h3>
    <a id=_Blending_8583267977864713_187 name=_Blending_8583267977864713_187></a> Blending
  </h3>
  <p>Each surface having been applied to a terrain sector has an associated 'visibility mask', which 
  dictates the coverage of the surface over the terrain. The blend mask is a gray-scale visibility 
  mask stored in an 8-bit format and is stored as a part of a 4 channel blend mask texture for each 
  terrain cell. At runtime the terrain shader uses this texture to blend the various maps together 
  and perform lighting calculations. As stated above, distribution masks from each layer, if 
  available, are also modulated with the visibility mask of a given layer.</p>

  <p>When painting materials in Toolbench, the masks are modified thereby changing which materials 
  are visible on the terrain. The masks are automatically normalized such that at any given point on 
  the terrain, the sum of the mask values is equal to 1.0. In some cases, such as when no material 
  is applied to the terrain, the shader will also blend in a magenta color to bring the sum to 
  1.</p>
  <h2>
    Textures
  </h2>
  <p>Each terrain material may specify a single texture for each of the following texture 
  'slots'.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Diffuse (Base) texture</b></li>
    <ul>
      A 3 channel texture representing the diffuse color of a particular material. It
      is expected that every material used on the terrain has one of these textures.</ul>
    <li><b>Detail texture</b></li>
    <ul>
      A single channel texture used when tiling to help overcome the emergence of visible
      patterns in the material.</ul>
    <li><b>Normal texture</b></li>
    <ul>
      A 3 channel texture representing the tangent space normal map for the surface.</ul>
    <li><b>Parallax texture</b></li>
    <ul>
      A single channel texture used to simulate heightfield displacement when rendering.</ul>
    <li><b>Specular texture</b></li>
    <ul>
      A 3 channel texture representing the specular color of a material.</ul>
    <li><b>Distribution texture mask</b></li>
    <ul>
      A single channel texture used to modulate the main blend mask of the material to
      achieve high detail blends between materials.</ul>
  </ul>
  <p>On shader model 2.0 cards, the normal map and parallax map are disabled when generating the 
  shaders for that platform. This is done to minimize the performance impacts of normal maps and 
  parallax maps on older hardware and to prevent artifacts appearing when using combinations of 
  materials that aren't supported on older hardware due to the complexity of the shaders.<br>
  </p>

  <h2>
    Texturing Examples
  </h2>
  <p>The following sections attempt to identify the effect of each texture slot available on a 
  material to illustrate their effect on the appearance of the terrain through some basic use 
  cases.</p>
  <h3>
    Using the Diffuse Texture
  </h3>
  <p>The diffuse texture being the most simple form of texture mapping available in the terrain 
  engine, this texture simply applies a tiled image to the surface of the terrain. The number of 
  times this texture is tiled across a single sector can be adjusted manually in the definition of 
  the surface or through the tools provided. This can be seen in the following images:</p>
  
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="text-align: center">
            <div class="FigureContainer">
              <img alt="Without diffuse texture" src="images/diffusewithout.png" style="WIDTH:320px; 
                HEIGHT:268.04px">
              <p class="FigureCaption">
                Without diffuse texture</p>
            </div>
          </td>
          <td style="text-align: center">
            <div class="FigureContainer">
              <img alt="With diffuse texture" src="images/diffusewith.png" style="WIDTH:320px; 
                HEIGHT:268.04px">
              <p class="FigureCaption">
                With diffuse texture</p>
            </div>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

  <h3>
    Using the Detail Texture
  </h3>
  <p>A detail texture may be assigned to a surface to help alleviate the tiling effect of the 
  diffuse texture when viewed from long distances. The detail texture is modulated with the diffuse 
  texture to help eliminate patterns that may emerge in the tiling. Like the diffuse texture, the 
  detail map may be configured to tile a specific number of times across a terrain.</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="Without detail texture" src="images/detailwithout.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              Without detail texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="With detail texture" src="images/detailwith.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              With detail texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
    

  <h3>
    Using the Normal Texture
  </h3>
  <p>A normal texture allows the user to provide detailed lighting information for a surface at 
  close ranges. This provides much higher quality lighting and a sense of texture to a surface.</p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="Without normal texture" src="images/normalwithout.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              Without normal texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="With normal texture" src="images/normalwith.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              With normal texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <h3>
    Using the Parallax Texture
  </h3>
  <p>A further extension of normal mapping, parallax textures allow the surface to have a 
  displacement map to be defined, giving the surface a sense of 3D shaping when the user moves 
  around the surface of the terrain. The screenshots below unfortunately do not show this effect 
  particularly well, as the effect is more pronounced as the camera pans across a scene. The amount 
  of displacement defined by the parallax texture is now configurable through the surface and the 
  tools provided.</p>
  
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="Without parallax texture" src="images/parallexwithout.png" style="width: 
              320px; height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              Without parallax texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="With parallax texture" src="images/parallexwith.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              With parallax texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <h3>
    Using the Specular Texture
  </h3>
  <p>The specular texture allows the definition of specular lighting colors on a per pixel basis at 
  close range, and a glossiness factor for long range. The specular power and intensity to use for 
  each surface may be assigned though the surface or the provided tools. Note: Specular textures are 
  an expensive feature of the terrain, their use is recommended in moderation.</p>
  
 <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="Without specular texture" src="images/specwithout.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              Without specular texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="With specular texture" src="images/specwith.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              With specular texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <h3>
    Using the Distribution Texture Mask
  </h3>
  <p>The distribution texture mask is a cheap method of improving detail when blending between two 
  different surfaces. Instead of blending linearly between the two surfaces, the distribution 
  texture provides a mask over which black areas will blend out before white areas. Ultimately 
  allowing other surfaces to show through another surface even though a low resolution blend mask 
  may be used. The following images demonstrate the changes in the blending effects that may be 
  achieved.</p>
  
   <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="Without distribution texture" src="images/distwithout.png" style="width: 
              320px; height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              Without distribution texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="With distribution texture" src="images/distwith.png" style="width: 320px;
              height: 268.04px">
            <p class="FigureCaption">
              With distribution texture</p>
          </div>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>One effect made possible by the distribution texture, is the overlay of parts of surface upon 
  another. In the following images, pieces of wheat are overlaid upon a rocky area.</p>
  
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td style="text-align: center">
          <div class="FigureContainer">
            <img alt="Without distribution texture" src="images/dist2without.png" style="width:

            <p class="FigureCaption">

          </div>
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: center">
        <div class="FigureContainer">
          <img alt="Creating paths of wheat on rock" src="images/dist2rockpath.png" style="width:

        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  
  <p>The distribution strength factor used in the above images is 50. Note: values above 255 do not 
  have any more effect than the value 255.</p>
  

<h2>Material Packages</h2>
  <p>Materials are generally organized into a set of packages. Each 'material package' may contain a 
  number of surfaces and are responsible for the allocation/de-allocation of surface resources. 
  Packages are independent of any specific terrain, and allow a set of materials to be grouped 
  together for reuse in multiple scenes.</p>
  <h3>
    Storage
  </h3>
  <p>
  	Material packages are now stored in XML files with the extension "tmpkg". These files store the configuration data of each
  	material and the list of textures that make up each texture slot of the materials. A second file is also stored with the extension "tmpkgb". This 
  	second file format is binary, and stores compiled versions of the terrain material textures to be sent to the video card. The "tmpkgb" file is optional
  	and is always regenerated when saving material packages from the tools. If the tmpkgb file is not available at runtime, then the textures will be generated
  	at runtime and may cause a performance decrease during loading. 
  </p>

<h2>The Surface Library</h2>
  <p>
  	The NiTerrainSurfaceLibrary class is used to organise and coordinate the loading and saving of all material packages and their surfaces to make them ready for use by an NiTerrain.
  	Every NiTerrain has a reference to a NiTerrainSurfaceLibrary and if one is not assigned to it, it will automatically create a new one for itself. By assigning the same Surface 
  	Libraries to multiple	terrain objects, the texture data for the surfaces that are used is shared. 
  </p>
  <p>
  	For information on the interface provided by the NiTerrainSurfaceLibrary class, please consult it's class documentation in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">
      <a href="../../Reference/NiTerrain/Introduction_to_NiTerrain_Class_Reference.htm">NiTerrain</a></span> library.
  </p>


<h2>Metadata</h2>
  <p>See <a href="NiTerrain_Meta_Data_System.htm">NiTerrain Metadata System</a> for details 
  regarding metadata in materials.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Currently, each terrain cell may have a maximum of 4 materials applied to it (a maximum of 4 
layer masks). Though a sector may have a large number of cells, and hence each sector supports the 
use of a moderate number of materials simultaneously.<br>
