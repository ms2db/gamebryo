<h1>Profiling Intermittent Slowdown</h1>

<p>Intermittent performance issues are the most difficult 
 to profile. If you are taking continuous performance data that is averaged 
 out such as from a sampling profiler, it may be impossible to see the 
 problem when the data is aggregated. On the other hand, if you are taking 
 data from a single frame or series of frames, it can be difficult to capture 
 the one or two frames that are slowing down application performance. Characterizing 
 the slowdown is the most important activity that you can perform when 
 dealing with intermittent performance issues.</p>

<h2>Try to Generate a Reproducible Case</h2>

<p>Generating a reproducible case is the most important 
 step you can take in profiling both intermittent and consistent slowdowns. 
 Doing so in the case of intermittent slowdowns allows us to apply the 
 techniques that work for consistent slowdown since we can now reproduce 
 the problem. With intermittent slowdown, there are a few things to look 
 at.</p>

<h3>Camera Angle Related Slowdowns</h3>

<p>Consider whether or not your slowdown is dependent on 
 the movement of the camera. Does it occur whenever the camera is pointed 
 in a certain direction? If so, fix the camera in that direction and proceed 
 to profile the performance using the techniques outlined for <a href="Profiling_Consistent_Slowdown.htm">consistent 
 slowdowns</a>. If the slowdown only occurs as the camera moves, your application 
 is probably performing some setup work for the objects that are entering 
 the view frustum. Check to make sure that you have precached your geometry 
 to minimize the setup of vertex buffers. Also, make sure that you aren't 
 suddenly going to the disk to load a texture or NIF file. If this is the 
 case, consider using the 
 <a href="../AssetRuntimeService/asset_load_loading.htm">Asset Loading Infrastructure</a>
 and the caching features found in the
 <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_scene_graph_svc.htm">
  Scene Graph Service</a> and
  <a href="../../Reference/QuickRef_Services/svc_qckref_animation_svc.htm">
 Animation Service</a> to pre-load assets in the background. When working with
 the Core Runtime alone, use the
 <a href="../../Reference/NiMain/NiStream.htm#BackgroundLoad">
 <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiStream</span> background 
 loading system</a> to predictively load your assets (do not mix this
 wth GameFramework scene graph loading). If the slowdown briefly 
 occurs every time you enter a section, you may be transferring a lot of 
 data to the GPU. Consider reducing the size of textures and see if that 
 improves performance.</p>

<h3>Game Object Related Slowdowns</h3>

<p>Sometimes a slowdown can be difficult to diagnose because 
 it only occurs when characters or objects move in and out of a scene. 
 If this is the case, try freezing the game time by passing a constant 
 time to Update. Using constant time will prevent objects from moving and 
 allow you to isolate precisely which objects are slowing down your scene.</p>
