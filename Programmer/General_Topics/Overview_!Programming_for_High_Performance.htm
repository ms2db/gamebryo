<h1>Overview of Programming for High Performance</h1>

<p>This section describes numerous ways that developers 
 can use knowledge of their data (as well as other game-specific shortcuts) 
 to optimize performance of their datasets and application(s) with Gamebryo.&nbsp; 
 Optimization methods are described, and references to more detailed documentation 
 pertaining to other optimizations (in some cases, per platform) are included.</p>

<p>One of the most important, and one of the most overlooked, 
 considerations for building a high-performance application is to pay attention 
 to performance from the very beginning of the project through to the very 
 end of the project. Performance impact should always be a factor in every 
 design decision, whether in code or in artwork. Further, frequent performance 
 assessments, analysis, and corrective measures throughout the development 
 of the product are critical to success. Attempting to correct serious 
 performance issues during the endgame of product development rarely succeeds.</p>

<p>This section describes the methods, tools, and techniques 
 for measuring and analyzing performance, and avoiding or correcting performance 
 issues in code. Other sections do the same for art assets built with <a href="../../Art/Max/Introduction_!Geometry_and_Performance.htm">3ds 
 max</a> or <a href="../../Art/Maya/Basic_Geometric_Considerations.htm">Maya</a>.</p>
