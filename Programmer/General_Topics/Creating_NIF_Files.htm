<h1>Creating NIF Files</h1>

<p>Gamebryo supports streaming of scene graphs, cameras, lights,
and other objects to and from disk. Gamebryo accomplishes this
streaming through the use of its own native NIF file format. This
native file format is not intended to be a competitor to other
well-accepted file formats, but it does provide Gamebryo users
with a convenient way to handle persistent storage during the
application development cycle.</p>

<p>There are two basic ways to create NIF files:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Exporting from Commercial Modeling Packages

        <p class="indent1">The <a href=
        "../../Art/Max/Max_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">Gamebryo 3ds
        max Plug-in</a> and <a href=
        "../../Art/Maya/Maya_Plug_in_Introduction.htm">Gamebryo
        Maya Plug-in</a> enable users to save data in Gamebryo
        format without leaving the modeling application.</p>
    </li>

    <li>Writing out Application-created Scenes

        <p class="indent1">Applications that create their own
        scenes can easily write their scenes to disk as NIF
        files. The application may have created the scene
        procedurally, such as a fractal landscape, or by writing
        an importer for the developer's own (possibly
        proprietary) file format.</p>

        <p class="indent1">Please see <a href=
        "../Object_Systems/Introduction_to_Object_Systems.htm">Object
        Systems</a> for details on the use of these objects.</p>

        <p class="indent1">This method is particularly useful for
        Gamebryo users with large libraries of models that were
        generated in an older model format (e.g., a Quake II
        file).</p>
    </li>
</ol>
