<h1>Behavior limitations</h1>

<p>In this release of Gamebryo LightSpeed, there are a few limitations related to behaviors.</p>

<h2>Transactions</h2>

<p>Currently, explicit transactions between two Entities are not supported. However, for
    applications in which the Entities are running on a single simulator, all single-tick Behaviors
    will act atomically.</p>

<h2>Direct calls to other entities</h2>

<p>Direct Behavior calls must not consume more than one tick because the Entity that is being
    called might be migrated or deleted from the current simulator at some point.</p>

<h2>Direct calls may not block</h2>

<p>Only Behaviors that have the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Immediate</span> trait set are allowed
    to be directed called by another Behavior. Immediate Behaviors may not use any of the Behavior
    API blocking calls and may not call other Behaviors in a blocking manner (such as calling <span
    class="NDLSystemFont">SendAndWaitForReply</span>).</p>

<h2>Bare references</h2>

<p>Holding direct references to data or another Entity is not supported within an Entity or
    Behavior. Passing pointers to objects and/or data should be avoided because an Entity may be
    deleted or migrated during the execution of a behavior and therefore a bare pointer would no
    longer be valid. Behaviors and Entities should always use an EntityID or string name to refer to
    other Entities and Behaviors if the reference persists between ticks. Note that in a single
    tick, the non-preemptive multitasking prevents any unexpected behavior.</p>

<h2>Scripting</h2>

<ul>
    <li>We do not provide support for removing behaviors from a script file that you are rapidly
    iterating on.</li>

    <li>Behaviors that are implemented in C++ must not block. They also must must not call scripted
    behaviors that block. They must complete and return in the current tick.</li>

    <li>Depending on the scripting language, you may be able to support a behavior that blocks (for
    example, Lua and Python both have the ability to do this). If blocked, the behavior will return
    control to the Scheduler and will be called again later after the event that it is waiting for
    has been received or after the specified amount of time has elapsed.</li>
</ul>
