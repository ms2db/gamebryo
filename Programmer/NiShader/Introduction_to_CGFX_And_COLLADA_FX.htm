<h1>Introduction to CGFX And COLLADA FX</h1>

<p>Gamebryo's NiShader system is a powerful way for applications 
 to make use of advanced rendering techniques, and the <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSF</span>/<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NSB</span> system makes it easy 
 to write advanced shaders and integrate their development into the art 
 pipeline. </p>
 
 <p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CGFX and COLLADA FX</span> 
 support extends that ease of use by allowing developers to use the CGFX
 file format to create Gamebryo shaders just as they would use <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSF</span> files directly.</p> 
	
 <p>When developing for PS3, CGFX shader files, and materials based on them,
 can be authored using tools such as FX Composer. The tools then convert and export these 
 assets as COLLADA FX files. COLLADA FX files are XML documents (with a .dae extension) that describe
one or more effects in full detail.</p>

 <p>Gamebryo provides a script, called BuildShader, that converts  
 COLLADA FX files to the NSF format and compiles the referenced CGFX files. As a result
 shader authors don't have to deal with COLLADA or NSF files directly. 
 
 Because the CGFX and COLLADA FX support is based on Gamebryo's <span class="NDLSystemFont">NiShader</span> 
 architecture, it would be useful to read the <a href="Introduction_to_Gamebryo_s_Shader_System.htm">documentation</a> 
 for the system before trying to understand this implementation of the 
 system.</p>

<p>Applications can request shaders, which encapsulates everything that is needed to render an object with a 
 given technique. By making use of the annotations and semantics that the CGFX 
 format provides, the parameters in the shader can be linked to Gamebryo 
 data, just as is possible with <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSF</span>/<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NSB</span> files that are created by hand. In addition, the 
 CGFX and COLLADA FX support provides the same data to the artist's tools that the hand written <span class="NDLSystemFont">NSF</span>/<span 
 class="NDLSystemFont">NSB</span> files do, allowing effects 
 contained in <span class="NDLSystemFont">CGFX</span> files 
 to be integrated into the art pipeline.</p>
