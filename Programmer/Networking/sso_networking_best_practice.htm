<h1>Best Practices for Working with Networking</h1>

<p>Refer to <a href="../Messages/message_best_practice.htm">Best practices for working
with messages</a> for best practices when you are working with messages. They apply to working
with remote messages as well as local messages. Emergent recommends the following additional best
practices when you are working with remote messages in particular:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Managing interest</b>&mdash;Use Categories to manage interest so that as few messages go
    to each process as possible. If you find that any handler is discarding messages because they
    do not apply, then consider using more Categories to determine where the messages are
    delivered. This is important when you are working with messages in general, but even more so
    when you are working with remote messages.</li>

    <li><b>Qualities of service</b>&mdash;Make sure messages are sent on the appropriate Quality of
    Service. If messages need to arrive quickly, consider an unreliable Quality of Service. Sending
    too many messages using reliable Qualities of Service will cause message queues to grow and
    increase the latency of all reliable messages.</li>

    <li><b>Logging</b>&mdash;Maintain log files for networking and/or message tracing separate from
    your main log file. Message trace logs can be extremely noisy, which impacts performance. It is
    handy to be able to turn them on and off easily. See <a href=
    "../Logging/logging_intro.htm">Logging, Asserts, and Debuggers</a>.</li>

    <li><b>Debug flags</b>&mdash;Familiarize yourself with the break-initiating debug flags in
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">IMessage</span>. It is tremendously useful to be able to initiate a
    breakpoint in a remote process when a message is received.</li>

    <li><b>Connections</b>&mdash;Use <span class="NDLSystemFont">AssignNetIDMessage</span> to
    determine when a connection has been established instead of <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">kMSGID_NetServiceConnectionEstablished</span>. The <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">kMSGID_NetServiceConnectionEstablished</span> message may be sent multiple
    times&mdash;once for each Quality of Service in use. <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">AssignNetIDMessage</span> will only be sent once the logical connection,
    including all Qualities of Service, is completed.</li>

    <li><b>Entity creation</b>&mdash;Do not attempt to create any Entities in response to either
    <span class="NDLSystemFont">AssignNetIDMessage</span> or <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">kMSGID_NetServiceConnectionEstablished</span>. In <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">kMSGID_NetServiceConnectionEstablished</span> messages, the NetID has not yet
    been set, and any Entities that are created before the NetID is set will not replicate
    properly. Because message handler order is not guaranteed and the EntityID factory is also
    initialized by <span class="NDLSystemFont">AssignNetIDMessage</span>, it is not safe to create
    Entities or load block files until the tick after <span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">AssignNetIDMessage</span> has been received.</li>
</ul>

<p>Emergent recommends the following best practices when you are tracking network connection status
and errors:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Endpoints</b>&mdash;Test applications with both endpoints running on the same machine to
    eliminate network-related problems and ensure that your application is functioning
    properly.</li>

    <li><b>Config files</b>&mdash;Where possible, share config files across multiple endpoints to
    avoid issues with misconfiguration. Don't repeat yourself!</li>

    <li><b>Port assignment</b>&mdash;Implement a port-assignment strategy across your enterprise.
    Multiple network applications running in the same environment can lead to port collisions and
    mysterious connection failures.</li>
</ul>
