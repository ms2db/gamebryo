<h1>Dodgeball Technology Highlights</h1>

<h2>Rag-doll Physics Integrated with Animation</h2>

<p>The Slim character in Dodgeball demonstrates the complete
rag-doll pipeline in Gamebryo. There are two major components to
this: Gamebryo's Animation Tool allows the preview of rag-doll
characters and the complete specification of transitions between
rag-doll and animation. For example, in Dodgeball the transition
from animation to physics is done through a cross-fade that
transfers the characters momentum to the physics system. The
transition back is a simple blend from the resting physics pose
to the beginning of a "getting-up" animation.</p>

<p>The model was authored in 3dsMax and rigged with a PhysX
rag-doll skeleton. A series of animations were created in Max and
split into sequences using Gamebryo Max plug-in. The same process
could have been done in Maya. The Gamebryo Animation Tool was
then used to preview the physical behavior of the character.
Animation Tool also enabled the artist to specify and preview all
of the transitions between key-framed animation and physical
control, and vice versa. The resulting animation data is loaded
into the Dodgeball application and only a few lines of code are
required to manage the rag-doll behavior.</p>

<p>Dodgeball is also the only major Gamebryo sample to use
animation accumulation. This is particularly useful while physics
is in control because it allows the root of the character model
to automatically follow the physical behavior. The root is then
in the correct position when the character needs to be smoothly
transitioned back to animation.</p>

<h2>Shadows</h2>

<p>Dodgeball uses Gamebryo's integrated shadow system for dynamic
shadows. Shadows are set up in 3dsMax or Maya, exported through
the Gamebryo tool chain and appear in the application with almost
no additional effort. Dodgeball also demonstrates how to add
shadow casters and receivers at run-time. Shadows are very
helpful in tracking where the balls are moving in 3D space.</p>
