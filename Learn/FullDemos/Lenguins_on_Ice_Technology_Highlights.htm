<h1>Lenguins on Ice Technology Highlights</h1>

<h2>General Information:</h2>

<ul>
	
	<li>Uses Gamebryo's PhysX 
 integration to allow for easy real-time dynamic scene interaction.</li>
	
	<li>The Lenguins on Ice 
 scene contains 50 fully animated baby lenguins each with fur rendering 
 and rigged with PhysX data.</li>
	
	<li>A customized effect 
 accumulator allows for easy and smooth integration of specialized rendering 
 effects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technology Highlights:</h2>

<ul>
	
	<li>Gamebryo's PhysX integration 
 enables the demo to handle large numbers of object interactions and collisions 
 within the scene. Through PhysX integration, the demo can easily switch 
 the control of a baby lenguin from the game logic to PhysX control and 
 back again.</li>
	
	<li>Each baby's fur is 
 rendered using the shells and fins technique. With up to 12 shells at 
 the highest LOD each baby has over 13k triangles. Having 50 babies at 
 this detail can create upwards of 650k polygons being fully animated, 
 skinned, and rendered in real-time every frame.</li>
	
	<li>The sample relies on 
 Gamebryo's fully integrated pixel and vertex shader support from art tools 
 to the run-time engine. The sample uses a combination of Gamebryo's integrated 
 support for FX Lite HLSL as well as using shaders generated from the Gamebryo 
 graphics pipeline. Being able to use FX files allows the sample to generate 
 specialized effects in the scene. Gamebryo's graphics pipeline allows 
 artists to apply desired effects to an object and have the engine generate 
 the shader required for the desired effects without any programmer intervention. 
 The artists generated the shader driven assets directly in 3ds max and 
 defined lighting and texturing effects in that tool. Gamebryo automatically 
 hooks raw asset lighting and shader controls together in the engine and 
 allowing easy integration of complex shaders into a scene. </li>
	
	<li>The use of per-pixel 
 lighting effects on every surface in the demo gives highly detailed surfaces 
 without overly dense geometry.</li>
	
	<li>This demo makes use 
 of a customized effect accumulator that copies the current contents of 
 the back buffer to an off-screen texture. This texture is used for a color 
 source when calculating refraction for each ice block as well as being 
 a color source for the heat shimmer effect.</li>
</ul>
