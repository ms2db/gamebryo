<h1>Mesh Dicer Tool</h1>

<p>The Mesh Dicer is a spatial partitioning tool primarily used
to optimize the efficiency of host-based operations, such as
picking or projected shadows, on relatively simple terrain
meshes. The tool groups the triangles of a scene graph into
partitions (or "bins") using a quad-tree organization. The
quad-tree will continue to be subdivided until the number of
triangles in a partition is lower than a user-defined threshold
(up to a maximum depth). The resulting partitioned scene graph is
then saved as a Gamebryo Nif file.</p>

<p>Note, however, that use of the Mesh Dicer tool is intended for
use with a single terrain mesh with a relatively low triangle
count (fewer than 64K), as in Lenguins on Ice. For terrain
solutions that deal with larger scale terrain, consider the
<a href="../../Programmer/NiTerrain/Introduction_to_NiTerrain_Library.htm">
NiTerrain</a> system.</p>

<h2>Running the Tool</h2>

<p>The command-line syntax of the Mesh Dicer tool is as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">MeshDicer.exe [-in
<em>TerrainNifName</em>] [-out <em>DicedTerrainNifName</em>] [-t
<em>TriangleCount</em>] [-st] [-d]</span></p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-in <em>TerrainNifName</em></span>
(Required) This parameter specifies the full path and file name
of the terrain Nif file used as input for the tool.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-out
<em>DicedTerrainNifName</em></span> (Required) This parameter
specifies the full path and file name of the "diced" terrain Nif
file produced by the tool. It represents a terrain scene graph
that has been partitioned using a quad-tree organization, to
optimize the efficiency of host-based operations, such as picking
or projected shadows.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-t <em>TriangleCount</em></span>
(Optional) This option specifies the maximum number of triangles
in a quadtree leaf partition. Its default value is 30.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-st</span> (Optional) This option
indicates that triangles which span two or more partitions will
exist in all such partitions.</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont">-d</span> (Optional) This option
indicates that each leaf partition will be self illuminated with
a random color (for debugging).</p>

<h2>How the Tool Works</h2>

<h3>Assumptions</h3>

<p>The following assumptions apply for the Mesh Dicer tool:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Triangles don't overlap, so the terrain is a uniform
    manifold surface.</li>

    <li>+Z is the world up axis.</li>

    <li>The single triangle mesh representing the terrain has
    fewer than 64K triangles.</li>

    <li>The terrain constitutes a surface where holes are
    possible, but caves, tunnels, and overhanging cliffs are not
    handled.</li>

    <li>The terrain is not animated.</li>

    <li>Ideally, triangles are relatively small and relatively
    uniform in size, which works best for a quad-tree subdivision
    approach, although this characteristic is not a
    requirement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Quad-tree Partitioning</h3>

<p>The input Gamebryo Nif file is a single terrain mesh. It could
be created via digital content creation tools or by other means.
The Mesh Dicer tool decomposes the terrain into a collection of
world space triangles. To accomplish this step, the world vertex
and normals are extracted from the scene into a large list.
Because all the data is kept in memory during processing, this
tool is not suitable for use with very large terrains (large in
terms of triangle count).</p>

<p>Next, a quad-tree is created for the terrain, oriented in the
XY plane. The quad-tree is centered on the terrain's bounding
volume center. A quad-tree node is created with a list of all the
triangles that overlap that partition. If the number of triangles
is below some threshold (the default is 30 triangles per
partition), then geometry is created at that partition (node) and
recursion stops. Otherwise, four new quad-tree nodes are created
(as child nodes) and subdivision continues, as needed, for each
child node, up to a maximum depth of 20.</p>
