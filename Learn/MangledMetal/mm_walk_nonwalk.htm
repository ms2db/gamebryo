<h1>MangledMetal: Walkables, NonWalkables &amp; Terrain</h1>

<p> MangledMetal employs a simple 2d collision system using top
down picking for characters to determine where they can go and where
they are blocked from moving. this is a simple 2d collision service and
is not a true 3d collision service. It was chosen for it easy of use
and simplicity in authoring.</p>
<p>The code the Walkable system exists exclusively in
the MangledMetal application and is not part of Toolbench or
World Builder by default. Walkables and NonWalkables are easy to create
and use if extending from the MangledMetal application.</p>

<p>In order to have a NIF file provide a walkable area, name some object in
the scene "Walkable". Based off of this naming convention, the walkable service
will consider that object and all objects below it in the scene graph as
walkable geometry. Similarly, any object named "NonWalkable" will have itself
and all objects below it block character movement.</p>

<p>In order to make picks more efficient and give more control over character
movement, a good way of structuring your scene is to have the walkable (or
non-walkable) portion of your scene as simplified geometry with no material
that is hidden.</p>

<p>Any geometry that should be considered should have CPU-readable vertex
positions. In MangledMetal, this is done by applying the 'PosNormPicking' mesh
profile from the DCC tools. For more information on applying mesh profiles
in the tools, see <a href="../../Art/Other/Introduction_To_Mesh_Profiles.htm">Introduction to Mesh Profiles</a>.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/Walkable_MeshProfile.jpg" width="186" height="355" alt="Walkable_MeshProfile (43K)" />
	    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption"></p> -->
</div>

<p>Terrain contains Walkable and NonWalkable metadata as well. The metadata
exists on the material so an artists or designer can simply paint
which areas of the terrain are accessible to the characters.</p>

<p>To create MetaData on a Terrain Material; Open the Terrain Material Editor in 
  the World Builder under Toolbench. Select the material that you wish to add meta 
  data to. At the bottom of the Terrain Material Editor plane, select the 
  Meta-Data Editor tab. Click &quot;Click here to add a new item...&quot;. Set the Key value 
  as either 'Walkable' or 'NonWalkable' and select Float as the Data Type.</p>
<p>The Float Value determines the threshold at which the percentage of
the material on the terrain will become 'Walkable' or 'NonWalkable'.
For example: The Material below becomes NonWalkable when 10% of it is
present on that triangle of the terrain.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/TerrainMaterialMetaData.png" alt="Terrain Material MetaData" />
	    <!-- <p class="FigureCaption"></p> -->
</div>

<p>Walkables override each other via the height. Where the highest
walkable becomes the height. So, if you have a mesh bridge going over
terrain it will be what the character walks on. If terrain is higher then a
mesh, then it is what the character walks on.</p>
<p>NonWalkables always take precedence over Walkable areas. If you
have a nonwalkable item below a walkable, that area will still
not be accessible. </p>
