<h1>MangledMetal blocks detail</h1>


<p>Level03.block is the main block file for the demo, and the default file to be loaded on Win32, Xbox360, and PS3.  It is a fully populated level with environment props, terrain, enemies, and spawn areas. It may take a minute or so to load.</p>
<p>Level01.block is a smaller block file that loads more quickly and uses fewer resources.</p>
<p>The terrain entity is locked. This is a safeguard that prevents it from being picked by accident when in selection mode in the render window. If you do need to select it, you can do so in the Entity View under the Environment folder. The terrain entity is instanced from the default PhysXTerrain entity model (PhysXModelLibrary).</p>

<p>The Terrain Entity comprises the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>root.terrain (terrain asset)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is created when the terrain is created in Toolbench. The assets for terrain 
  for each block are kept within the terrain folder, which is located in the following location:</p>

<p><span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\GameDemos\MangledMetal\Data\MangledMetal\GamebryoData\Generic\Terrain</span></p>

<p>The Block file is organized into the following folders:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Characters: Contains all player characters</li>
  <li>Enemies: Contains all enemy characters</li>
  <li>Environment: Contains all trees and rocks, graves, gates, etc. These are further split into 12 &quot;Regions&quot;; items grouped into a given region are hidden when that region is not visible to the player in order to improve performance. </li>
  <li>Lighting: Contains the light nodes for the level </li>
  <li>Nodes: Contains miscellaneous assorted models like waypoints for enemy AI's and the base PhysX scene. (Any block file that uses PhysX needs a PhysXScene Entity. This entity can be instanced from the existing Entity Model in the PhysXModelLibrary.) </li>
  <li>RegionTriggers: Contains the trigger areas to make the environment regions visible or invisible. As the player passes through trigger regions, the game toggles environmental objects in other parts of the block file visible and invisible.</li>
</ul>

<p>The level contains three trigger examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A simple radius trigger, Door03_Gate0. If the player
  enters the radius of the trigger, the response is to open the gate.</li>
  <li>The second is a more complicated trigger that requires an item,
  SoulCage_forGate0, to be destroyed before the gate will open.</li>
  <li>The final trigger example is the SpawnTemple, found at the end of
  the level. This entity is set to constantly keep five active Reaper
  Enemies in the level at any one time. It can be deactivated by
  destroying the two SoulCages in front of it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other items of interest in MangledMetal.block are the Reapers and
Deathripper enemies, which are scattered throughout. Most enemies are set to patrol the waypoints that are placed around the traversable parts of the
level. There are &quot;Pedestrians&quot; in the level - noncombatant humans who run in fear when you approach. There are also a few PhysX props set in the level. These include the large blocks and walls that can toppled and pushed around the level. These serve as a basic example of simple PhysX working in a .block file.</p>
