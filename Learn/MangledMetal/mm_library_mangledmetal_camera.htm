<h1>MangledMetal Camera</h1>

<p>The gameplay camera has a single subject entity at any given time. The camera translates toward
and away from the subject along a rail that is calculated at runtime. The shape of the rail is
determined by a hinge on the horizon (tunable) such that, normally, the top edge of the
camera&rsquo;s field of view is aligned with hinge regardless of the distance from the camera to
the subject. The rail has a near-subject camera stop point that sets the minimum distance from the
camera to the subject. The camera stop point exists on a ring that is a given height (tunable)
above the subject&rsquo;s ground point and a given distance (tunable) from the subject&rsquo;s
vertical center line. The rail has a far-subject camera stop point that is determined by the
maximum camera-hinge-subject angle (tunable).</p>

<p>Regardless of translation the camera always rotates towards a focus point that is a given height
(tunable) above the subject&rsquo;s ground point. Having a focus point separate from the
near-subject camera stop point allows some variety in the close-in perspective:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When the focus point and near-subject camera stop point are the same, the camera appears to
    simply zoom into the subject along the rail with the horizon locked at the hinge. That is, the
    hinge will appear to be fixed on the screen and no terrain beyond the hinge will be
    visible.</li>

    <li>When the focus point is above the near-subject camera stop point, the horizon appears to
    flare up gradually as the camera gets closer to the subject and the camera will be pointed
    upwards when it hits the camera stop point.</li>

    <li>When the focus point is below the near-subject camera stop point, the horizon appears to
    close in as the camera gets closer to the subject and the camera will be pointed downward when
    it hits the camera stop point.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following models in the MangledMetal library are used to control camera parameters. The
<a href="mm_camera_service.htm">MmCameraService</a> implements the actual camera at runtime.</p>

            <td>This model should be mixed in to the entity that will be used as the subject of the
            camera. If an entity that is not an MMCameraSubject is used as the subject of the
            camera, default values will be used for the properties that MMCameraSubject defines,
            and the defaults may not be pleasing. Note that the MMCameraSubject model does not
            select that entity as the camera subject; it just defines and sets parameters that will
            be used by the camera. The Player entity is the only entity that needs this model mixed
            into it in the current implementation of MangledMetal.</td>
