<h1>CollisionTestDynamic Demo Overview</h1>

<p>The <span class="NDLSystemFont">CollisionTestDynamic</span> demo demonstrates how to use the Gamebryo collision detection system with dynamic objects (objects moving with velocity).</p>

<p>The demo enables the user to throw "projectiles" (cans of
soup) in an empty room that has complex geometry. These moving
objects can collide with the walls, ceiling, floor, columns, and other moving objects. When two objects collide, they alter each others' courses, unless one of the objects is at rest (in which case, for the purposes of this sample, it will remain at rest). Performance remains high, even when many objects are
potentially colliding every frame of the animation.</p>

<p>The demo takes full advantage of collider vs. collidee
grouping for optimal performance. In general, the distinction between the two groups is as follows:

<ul>
  <li>colliders&mdash; These objects' movement may cause collisions with other colliders and other collidees</li>
  <li>collidees&mdash;These objects' motion will not cause collisions with other collidees</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of this demo, all collidees are stationary. When an object is characterized as a collidee, it will never be tested against any other collidee. When a bullet comes to rest, it is transitioned to the collidees group. This speed up functions because in this demo the bullets are not allowed to move again after coming to rest. See also the information on <a href=
"../../Reference/NiCollision/Collision_Groups.htm">Collision
Groups</a> for more details on the dramatic performance
improvements that are possible via such techniques.</p>

<p>The demo also includes the use of ABV
(alternate bounding volume) trees. An ABV tree is a hierarchical
structure of tight-fitting bounding volumes, created by an artist
to closely match the actual geometry. For other examples of using
ABVs to do dynamic collision detection involving characters,
see investigate the <a href=
"../FullDemos/MetalWars_Overview.htm">MetalWars</a> or <a href=
"../FullDemos/MOUT_Sample.htm">MOUT</a> Game Demos.</p>

<p>The other option for collision hierarchies is OBB (oriented
bounding box) trees. The <a href="Purpose_!CollisionTestStatic.htm">Collision Test Static</a> demo can show both OBBs and ABVs.</p>

<p>The demo also provides an example of the use of
collision detection callback functions to track all the
collisions that occur during a collision frame. In particular,
the callback keeps track of the minimum time at which a specific
bullet will collide with another object. The update function
can handle the first object the bullet will hit during a
collision frame, as part of determining the collision
response.</p>

<p>Finally, the demo provides one example of how to approximate
the physics for such considerations as gravity and collision
response (dissipation of energy, angular velocity, and so on).</p>
