<h1>Matchmaking Sample Functional Overview</h1>

<p>Matchmaking functionality is controlled via platform-specific
libraries that setup matchmaking and gameplay. A number of
parameters control game configuration such as map
dimensions.</p>

<h2>Matchmaking</h2>

<p>The details of matchmaking are platform-specific and are
implemented using platform-specific libraries.</p>

<ul>
    <li>PS3&mdash;<span class=
    "NDLSystemFont">efdNetLibPS3UDPP2P</span> is a PS3-specific
    networking library that makes use of Sony's NP Matching 2 and
    Signaling utilities. For more information, see <a href=
    "../../ee_goto.htm#Learn/SSO/sso_ps3_np_match_intro_ps3.htm">PS3
    NP Matching/Signaling</a>.</li>

    <li>Xbox 360&mdash;efdNetLibXbox360XRNM is an Xbox
    360-specific networking library sample that makes use of
    Microsoft Xbox 360 XRNM API. For more information, see
    <a href=
    "../../ee_goto.htm#Learn/SSO/sso_xbox_xrnm_reliable_udp_intro_xbox360.htm">
    Xbox 360 XRNM reliable UDP</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Matchmaking sample uses these libraries to setup the game.
One game instance acts as the host and creates the game. The
other game instances act as peers and join that game. The game
starts when the required number of players join the game.</p>

<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>The game is a simple simulation of teamed warships that fire on
each other until all of a teams' ships are eliminated. There are
two teams of warships. One is owned by the single simulated host
player. The other team is jointly-owned by all connected simulated peer
players. Each connected peer player has one ship. The host player
starts with a number of ships equal to the number of peer ships.
That is, there is one host ship for each connected peer.</p>

<p>Game play is implemented using messaging. The host is the
trusted game play arbitrator and the sole evaluator of team shot
results. Host player shots are evaluated immediately and the
results are sent to all peers via network messages. Peer player
shots are sent to the host via network messages. Those shots are then
evaluated and the results are sent to all of the peers.</p>

<p>The game is played on two equally sized rectangular game maps,
one for each team. The host maintains a map of the peer team's
game space as well as the host team's game space. This is
required for initial ship placement and shot evaluation. The host
updates its maps according to evaluated shot results. Peer
players maintain only a single map of the discovered host
player's game space (an instance for each peer). They use this to
ensure that they do not fire on the same host team's square twice.
Peers' maps are updated by the host via ShotResult messages
whenever there is a new shot result in the host player's game
space.</p>

<p>After waiting a random amount of "think" time, the host player fires all of his ships' guns at the same time. Each peer player fires
his ship's guns after waiting a random amount of "think" time as well. The peer player "think" time starts after he receives the result for his previous shot. The think time is calculated using a uniform distribution between a
minimum value and a maximum value. This scheme allows for a large
degree of randomness in message exchange without being completely
asynchronous.</p>

<p>Game play continues until all of the ships on one team are
eliminated. When that happens, the host sends the EndGame message
to all remaining peers and begins shutting down.</p>

<h2>Game Configuration</h2>

<p>There are several parameters within <span class="NDLSystemFont">ConfigCommon.ini</span> that can be used to modify game
play.</p>
