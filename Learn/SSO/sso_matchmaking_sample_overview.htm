<h1>Matchmaking Sample Overview</h1>

<table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">

            <div class="NDLNote">
                The Matchmaking sample is not currently supported on the PC
                platform.

<p>The Matchmaking sample demonstrates how to create a simple multiplayer
network game using a matchmaking host. It also demonstrates how to implement
multiplayer gameplay via messaging.</p>

<p>One instance of the sample will act as the host and will attempt to create
the game on the platform-specific matchmaking host. It will then wait in the
"lobby" for the peer players to join the game. The rest of the sample instances
will act as peers and will attempt to join the game created by the host
instance. After the configured number of peer players have joined the game, the
host instance will start the actual game play.</p>

<p>The game itself is a simple simulation of teamed warships that fire on each
other until all of a team's ships are eliminated. There are two teams of
warships. One team is owned by the single simulated host player. The other team
is owned by all connected simulated peer players. Each connected peer player
controls one ship. The host player starts with a number of ships equal to the
number of peer ships. That is, there is one host ship for each connected
peer.</p>

<h2>Source Location</h2>

<p>By default, source for the Matchmaking sample installs in the following
location:</p>

<p><span class=
"NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\OnlineTechDemos\MatchmakingSample</span></p>

<h2>Running the Sample</h2>

<p>For general information about running samples on Win32 and supported
consoles, see <a href="../../GetStart/All/getstart_samples.htm">Running
Gamebryo LightSpeed Samples</a>. Depending on the platform that you plan to run
the sample on, you might have to perform some additional configuration.</p>

<p>If you are running this sample on the Xbox 360 or PS3, you need to make sure
that you are signed in to Xbox Live or Playstation Network before starting the
application. Refer to the manufacturer's documentation for instructions on how
to sign in to these networks.</p>

<p>For the Matchmaking sample, the two most important parameters for starting a
new game are defined in the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ConfigCommon.ini</span>
file.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>

            <th>Description</th>

            <th>Default</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Game.PeerPlayersDesired</span></td>

            <td>Number of peer players that must join the game before actual
            game play starts.</td>

            <td>1</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td><span class="NDLSystemFont">Game.Host</span></td>

            <td>Determines if this instance should host a new game (true) or
            join an existing game.</td>

            <td>False</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>The host instance should be started first. However, before you start the
host, you need to override the default setting for the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Game.Host</span> parameter via the command line (or via a
temporary change to the <span class="NDLSystemFont">ConfigCommon.ini</span>
file). Set this parameter to TRUE. If you want to run a game with more than two
players, you also need to override the <span class=
"NDLSystemFont">Game.PeerPlayersDesired</span> parameter's default value (1).
For example, if you want to run a game with four players, set the parameter to
3. (This parameter is not used by the peer instances.)</p>
