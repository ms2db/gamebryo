  <h1>
    Editing and Using Materials
  </h1>
  <p>
    Using Toolbench, materials can be created, edited, and selected for application
    onto the terrain. The interface to interact with materials is the Terrain Material
    Editor panel. Open the panel by selecting 'View'-&gt;'Terrain Material Editor'.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Material Editor Panel
  </h2>
  <p>
    The Terrain Material Editor panel allows for viewing, creating, deleting, and editing
    material packages and materials.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Material Packages
  </h2>
  <p>
    Material packages are named groupings which can store data about many individual
    materials. They allow for a classification system of materials and are stored as
    XML code with the file extension .tmpkg. Packages are independent of any specific
    terrain, and allow a set of materials to be grouped together for reuse in multiple
    scenes. Valid material packages located within a user's asset web when Toolbench
    is launched will be loaded into the list of current material packages in the Terrain
    Material Editor, and any materials they contain will automatically be loaded and
    be available for painting onto the terrain using the material paint brush.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Creating Material Packages
  </h2>
  <p>
    To create a new material package, click the button to the left of the Material Packages
    list. This will bring up a window allowing the user to specify the name and location
    of a new, empty material package. Material packages must have unique names.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Creating a Material
  </h2>
  <p>
    A material can be created from within Toolbench and added to any material package,
    including packages newly created or already loaded. To create a material, a specific
    package must first be selected in the X dropdown menu. (Note, this does not include
    the 'All Packages' menu option.) Then, the 'create material' icon located at the
    top of the Terrain Material Editor toolbar will be enabled. Clicking this will add
    a new, blank material definition to the selected package. The material will initially
    have a default name of the format 'MaterialX' where X is some generated number.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Editing a Material
  </h2>
  <p>
    In order to rename a material, double-click on the material name, and a textbox
    will enable a new name to be entered for the selected material.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each material may contain a up to six textures including a diffuse texture, detail
    texture, normal mapping texture, parallax mapping texture, distribution mask, and
    specular texture. Further details about materials can be found in the materials
    section. In order to load a texture into a texture slot, click on the texture slot
    above the texture name which will then open a window to select and load a texture.
    Textures should be stored as appropriate image files and be located within the asset
    web.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Deleting a Material
  </h2>
  <p>
    To delete a material select the specific material to be deleted from the list of
    materials in a package. This will enable the 'delete material' icon located at the
    top of the Terrain Material Editor toolbar.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: A material currently painted on the terrain cannot be deleted from a material
    package. To resolve this, first remove the material from the terrain and then proceed
    to delete the material from the package.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Removing a Material from the Terrain
  </h2>
  <p>
    Right-clicking on a material in the Terrain Material Editor window will bring up
    the menu option to 'Remove from terrain'. Clicking this option should remove this
    material from the terrain entirely. If this option is disabled, the selected material
    is not currently painted onto the terrain. This operation allows for the rapid removal
    of a material from a terrain. Note: A material must not be painted anywhere on the
    terrain in order to delete it from a material package.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Exploring Material Parameters
  </h2>
  <p>
    Additional material parameters can be edited once a material is selected using the
    'Material Parameters' tab at the bottom of the Terrain Material Editor window. The
    available parameters include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tiling </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting tiling sets the scale of the material. The scale determines how many times
        the material is repeated across the terrain. A larger value means less tiling will
        occur. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Detail Texture Tiling </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting detail texture tiling sets the scale for the detail map of the material.
        The detail map may have a different scale than the material itself to provide higher
        frequency details when the material is viewed up close. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Parallax Strength </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The strength by which the material's parallax map offsets the surface's UV coordinates.
        This should be adjusted based on the type of material. For example, a rock material
        may have a larger parallax offset then small pebbles. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Distribution Mask Strength </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The strength in which the distribution mask is applied to the material. The strength
        is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 where 0.0 implies the distribution mask has no affect
        resulting in a linear blend between materials based on the terrain blend masks.
        As this value approaches 1.0 the blending between the borders of materials become
        more and more controlled by the distribution map. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Specular Power </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The exponent to the specular lighting equation for the material. </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Specular Intensity </li>
    <ul>
      <li>The specular intensity of the material which determines the strength of the specular
        map when set on the material. </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
