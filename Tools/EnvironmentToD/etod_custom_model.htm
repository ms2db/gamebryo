    Creating Custom TimeOfDay Models

  <h2>
    The Creation of the Custom Model
  </h2>
  <p>
    Creating a custom model starts in the EntityModelProject. Users will first need
    to create a new model. This will hold as many properties as needed and mix in as
    many other models as required. In order for a model to be used with the time of
    day editor, the TimeOfDayEditable model must be added as a mixin.

  </div>
  <p>
    Adding the newly created model to the scene will now prompt the user with the Set
    Time Of Day file window. However no properties have been selected to add to the
    time of day editor.
  </p>
  <p>
    The properties that should be used within the Time Of Day editor must have the trait
    TimeOfDayAnimatable selected (Fig.2). A mixin property's trait can only be changed after setting the property as overriden. This is modified by selecting the model in
    the EMT project view.
  </p>
  <p>
    The time of day editor will use several different information from each properties.
    The default value will be used as the initial value when first adding the entity.
    If a range restriction has been defined on a float type property, it will be used
    as the minimum and maximum values set on the editor's graph. If no restrictions
    have been set, minimum will default to 0 and maximum to 1. If the default range
    is not suitable, it can be modified within the time of day editor. If a description
    has been given to the property, it will be used by the tooltip to display more information.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Adding the Entity to the Scene
  </h2>
  <p>
    Once the model has been created, it can be added to the block. It is very important
    to note that only one instance of a certain model type can ever be created for use
    with the TimeOfDayEditable model.
