<h1>Adding and previewing sequences in the Animation Tool</h1>

<p>You can use the Animation Tool to add and preview sequences.</p>
 
<p class="NDLHeadingProcedure">To add and preview sequences</p>

<ol> 

	<li>Launch the Gamebryo Animation Tool.
	
  	<div class="FigureContainer">
      <img src="images/animation_tool_ui_empty.png" width="640" height="469" alt="animation_tool_ui_empty (104K)" />
  	</div>
	</li>

	<li>Load a character model by selecting <span class="NDLGUILabel">Character Model</span> in the Project View. There are two components to the character model: the NIF file associated with the character; and the node in the scene graph that is the root of the animation hierarchy. Because neither of these have been set up yet, both fields state that the values are &lt;UNDEFINED&gt;. The Edit View should now look like the example below.

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_1_CharacterEditView.jpg" width="308" height="150"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>
	
	<li>Click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Select File</span> button in the Edit View. In the Open Character NIF dialog box, navigate to and double-click the NIF file associated with the character. For example:

	<p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\Models\AnimationToolExamples\Killbot\Killbot Default_Pipeline\Killbot.nif</span></p>
	</li>
	
	<li>Once you have selected the file that is associated with the character, you need to select the root of the animation hierarchy. If you have set up your animations in a content creation package like 3ds max or Maya, this node will be the same node that was specified as the actor root in those tools. In most cases, this will be the parent node to the node with &quot;NonAccum&quot; in the name. In the Select Character Root dialog box, expand the scene graph and select the node named <span class="NDLGUILabel">Sequence node</span> and then click <span class="NDLGUILabel">OK</span>.

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_2_CharacterRoot.jpg" width="424" height="416"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>
	
	<li>The Edit View should now look like the image below. You can hover your mouse over the <span class="NDLSystemFont">killbot.nif</span> filename to view the full path to the file within a ToolTip.

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_3_CharacterEditView2.jpg" width="308" height="150"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>	

	<li>In the Project View, click <span class="NDLGUILabel">Sequences</span> in the tree. The Edit View should now match the image below. Click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Add Sequences from KF File(s)</span> button in the Edit View. (For convenience, this can also be done from the main toolbar or by right-clicking <span class="NDLGUILabel">Sequences</span> in the Project View.)

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_4_SequencesEditView.jpg" width="310" height="125"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>
	
	<li>In the Open KF File(s) dialog box, choose a .KF file that contains the sequences that you want to work with. For example:

	<p class="indent1"><span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\Models\AnimationToolExamples\Killbot\Killbot Default_Pipeline\Killbot.kf</span></p>

	<p class="indent1">The sequences will now be visible in the Project View, and, if you selected the <span class="NDLSystemFont">Killbot.kf</span> example, you will also see default transitions created between the sequences.</p>
	
    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_5_AddedSequences.jpg" width="640" height="499" 
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>	

	<li>Select a sequence from the Project View. The Render View updates to reflect your sequence selection. For example, if you are viewing the samples that we've previously mentioned, you can select <span class="NDLGUILabel">walk</span> from the Project View.

	<p class="indent1">Notice that a time slider has appeared at the bottom of the Render View. The time slider has several usages in the Animation Tool. It displays the current position in the sequence as the diamond shaped bar. The downward facing arrows indicate the location of the text keys in the sequence. Moving the mouse over a text key marker will display the text of the key as well as the exact time at which it occurs in a ToolTip. The animation playback controls are located to the right of the time slider. </p>

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_6_ActivatedWalkSequence.jpg" width="660" height="644"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>
	
	<li>Click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Pause</span> button. You can drag the current position marker on the time slider. The playback will change to match the time slider. The buttons on either side of the time slider allow you to step time one frame.</li>
	<li>Click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Play</span> button. If you want to see animation play back faster or slower, drag the slider at the bottom right corner of the Render View.

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_7_CloseUpControls.jpg" width="105" height="84"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>
	
	<li>Review sequence properties, evaluators, and text keys in the Edit View. For example, in the image below, the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Bone Pelvis</span> evaluator is expanded to show information about the keys used by that evaluator. The <span class="NDLGUILabel">Sequence Text Keys</span> rollout provides information about the various text keys that occur in the sequence.

    <div class="FigureContainer">
        <img src="./images/1_8_Evaluators.jpg" width="305" height="748"
    />
        <!-- <p class="FigureCaption">{Figure caption}</p> -->
    </div>
	</li>	

	<li>Select <span class="NDLGUILabel">File > Save As</span> to save your project.
	
	<p class="indent1">KFM files use relative paths to reference the NIF and 
 KF files that you have selected, so you can save the KFM file anywhere 
 you want and it will be able to load the NIF and KF files when you open 
 the file again. However, you cannot move the KFM file to a different location and expect it to still be able to find the NIF and KF files. In this case, the Animation Tool will prompt you to find these files when it loads the KFM file.</p>
 </li>

</ol>

<p>You have now added and previewed a sequence and you have saved your project so you can return to it later.</p>
