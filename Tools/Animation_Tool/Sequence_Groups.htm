<h1>Sequence Groups</h1>

<p>A sequence group is a set of two or more sequences that are simultaneously blended together. Each sequence has an associated weight that defines its contribution to the final animation. When activated, a sequence in the group will ease in from zero to its target weight. When deactivated, a sequence in the group will ease out from its current target weight to zero.</p>

<p>In the Gamebryo Animation Tool, you can manipulate sequence groups in a testbed so you can tweak the available parameters and see what the final result will be. Not all sequences contain the same bones or animation channels. Sometimes it isn't obvious what the result will be when blending sequences together. For this reason, the tool gives you the ability to mix and match sequences in sequence groups. Once you have created these groups, it is a trivial matter for a programmer to access your art to drive the game character's animation.</p>

<a name=Synchronize_To></a><h2>Synchronize To</h2>

<p>Just as in a morph transition, some sequences may need additional information to properly blend together. These sequences are usually annotated in the source art package by adding text keys to the animation channels. These text keys provide markers or cues to the animation system that can be synchronized between the sequences. These annotations are what allow walk and run animations to synch up so that the character's feet stay planted even though the durations of these sequences do not match. Each sequence in a sequence group can optionally synchronize with another sequence.</p>

<a name=Priority></a><h2>Priority</h2>

<p>Blending sequences may not always fit into the full body to full body blend paradigm. In some cases, you may want to create sequences that affect a subset of the overall bones. For instance, in a shooting sequence, you may only choose the bones in the upper body to participate in the sequence. Blending this shooting sequence with a full body walk animation will produce odd results. The lower body, which essentially only has one active sequence, will play as normal. The upper body will blend the walk with the upper body shoot, usually with the effect of having the hands slip from the weapon. To solve this problem, each sequence in a sequence group has a priority number. This number essentially defines a mask for the blend. Each bone or other animated track affected will only blend sequences with the highest priority present. If the previously mentioned upper body shoot animation was given a higher priority than the walk cycle, the result would be the upper body animating from the shooting sequence and the lower body would be animating from the walk sequence.</p>

<p>You need to take special care when you create sequences that will be blended via priorities. In two-legged characters, the pelvis is often used as the dividing line for the character into upper and lower body sequences. However, if the pelvis is the root bone in the hierarchy, this can produce oddly stiff upper body animations that do not match their lower body counterparts. The visual result of this is often violent jerking movements in the upper body animation as the effect of the hips is not counterbalanced.</p>

<a name=Additive></a><h2>Additive</h2>

<p>Sequence groups also allow additive blending to be tested out.  Each sequence has a checkbox for whether or not it is being additively blended with other sequences.  By default, the first frame of that sequence is used as the reference frame for generating the animation delta to add to the pose.</p>
