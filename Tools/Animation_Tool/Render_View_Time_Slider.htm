<h1>Render View time slider</h1>

<p>You can use the Render View time slider to view individual sequences in the animations that you are previewing. Additionally, colored bands within the slider convey information about transitions within animations that you preview.</p>

<p>You use the time slider slightly differently depending on the transition type. The type of information that it conveys is also dependent on the transition type. For some, but not all, transition types, you can set the initial transition point. However, the following characteristics are consistent regardless of transition type:</p>
 
<ul>
  <li>A green region within the time slider indicates the length and time for the source sequence to run</li>
  <li>A red region within the time slider indicates the duration that the destination sequence is active.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time sliders for each of the major transition types are illustrated below.</p>

<h4>Sequence</h4>

<p>When you view a sequence, no transition exists, so only a green band displays. This green band indicates the full length of the sequence. Below the sequence bar, 3 times display. The first and last time indicate the start and end times of the sequence. The time in the middle indicates the current time in the sequence. This last time indicator also corresponds to the current position of slider scrubber.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/TimeSlider_Sequence.jpg" width="526" height="90"
/>
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Time slider - Sequence</p>
</div>

<p>The six buttons beside the slider enable you to navigate the animation. The smaller slider beneath the buttons enables you to control the playback speed via a time multiplier. By default, this multiplier is at 1.00x (normal) speed.</p>

<h4>Immediate Blend</h4>

<p>An immediate blend is a transition that transitions from a frame in the source sequence to a frame in the destination sequence. When you preview any transition, at least two color bands display: a green band indicates the duration of the source sequence; and a red band indicates the time spent in the destination sequence. In addition, for immediate and delayed blends, a yellow band indicates the time spent transitioning between the two frames.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/TimeSlider-ImmediateBlend.jpg" width="527" height="89"
/>
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Time slider - Immediate blend</p>
</div>

<p>During preview you can set where the transition will occur in the source by moving the transition marker. (This marker is the small + sign above the yellow band in the example above). You can use the transition marker to select any time within the first loop of the source sequence.</p>

<h4>Delayed Blend</h4>

<p>Delayed blends operate almost exactly like immediate blends, except you can control where the desired transition point occurs. The actual transition point will occur at one of the blend pairs that is specified for the delayed blend. The blend pairs display as black arrow markers above and below the time slider.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/TimeSlider-DelayedBlend.jpg" width="526" height="89"
/>
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Time slider - Delayed blend</p>
</div>

<p>In the above example, the actual transition will occur at the first blend pair marker (the black arrow on top) and not at the point of the transition marker. This is indicated by the fact that the green source band extends some distance beyond the right of the transition marker.</p>

<h4>Cross Fade</h4>

<p>Cross fades and morphs differ from immediate and delayed blends; they do not solely transition from one frame to another. Instead, they transition across numerous frames depending on the duration of the transition. This fact is indicated by the fade out of the source and the fade in of the destination regions.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/TimeSlider-CrossFade.jpg" width="528" height="89"
/>
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Time slider - Cross fade</p>
</div>

<p>In the above example, the green band (the source sequence) fades out just as the red (destination sequence) band fades in.</p>

<h4>Morph</h4>

<p>Morphs are displayed like cross fades, but they additionally display information about morph tags.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/TimeSlider-Morph.jpg" width="533" height="89"
/>
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Time slider - Morph</p>
</div>

<p>In the example above, the dark arrows indicate morph tags, and the ToolTip displays when you hover your mouse cursor over a morph tag. At any time and for any transition, you can move the mouse cursor over various regions on the time slider to view additional information within ToolTips. Because morphs are synchronized by morph tags, interesting non-linear behavior can occasionally be seen as you move the transition marker, depending on how the morph tags are set. This happens because time is being warped during the morph to synchronize the two sequences.</p>

<h4>Chain</h4>

<p>Chains are displayed using the same representation as the individual transitions between the sequences in the chain. The limitation of viewing chains is that you cannot specify an initial transition point. Also, blend pairs and morph tags are not displayed. However, visual cues for immediate blends, delayed blends, morphs, and cross fades are still visible. Another thing to note is that the green/red distinction for source and destination is no longer applicable; the destination for one transition is the source for another. Instead, green and red sections are alternated to distinguish the various sequences in the chain.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/TimeSlider-Chain.jpg" width="532" height="89"
/>
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Time slider - Chain</p>
</div>

<p>In the above example, a chain with three transitions occurs for a total time of 9.500 seconds. The first transition appears to be a type of blend (a yellow bar indicating a frame to frame transition) while the next transition appears to be a morph or cross fade. The final transition, like the first, also appears to be a type of blend.</p>
