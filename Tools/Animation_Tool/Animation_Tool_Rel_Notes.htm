<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a><h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Added toggle buttons to the tool bar for several new debug visualization modes: nodes, hierarchy/bones, and bounding spheres.</li>

    <li>Added buttons to cycle between the various cameras in the scene so that camera animation transitions can be previewed.</li>

    <li>Fixed a problem in Animation Tool with physical sequences in transition preview with
    accumulation. The ordering of reset events was causing stale data to find its way from
    physics into the animation accumulation system, resulting in bad accumulation settings.
    Visually this manifested as an offset of debug geometry and extraneous rotations during
    the transition.</li>

    <li>Disabled debug geometry rendering of the ground plane physics object. The
    ground plane debug geometry was causing the scene to have a very large bound,
    which caused the camera controls to misbehave.</li>
    
    <li>Fixed a crash bug when a sequence was made physical while active and then another sequence
    was activated.
    </li>
    
    <li>Changed the versioning of the project settings file to use the NIF version rather than
    the SDK version. This change will not affect existing content in any way.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.6</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Enhanced the PhysX 
 user interface so the user may revert physics based sequences back to 
 standard animation sequences. Previously, it was not possible to convert 
 physics based sequences to normal animations because the original animation 
 keys had been deleted (which is no longer the case).</li>
	
	<li>Updated the sequence 
 information displayed in the Animation Tool to reflect the fact that sequences 
 now utilize evaluators instead of interpolators. The "Sequence Interpolators" 
 rollout is now entitled "Sequence Evaluators".</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a couple UI issues 
 regarding synchronization sequences within sequence groups. Previously, 
 the sequence group UI could get into an inconsistent state with respect 
 to which sequences were actually active.</li>
	
	<li>Added a message box 
 that informs the user when a synchronization sequence is about to be deactivated 
 within a sequence group. The revised text explains the new behavior of 
 the Animation Tool; namely, the dependent sequences will be deactivated 
 and cannot be reactivated until this synchronization sequence is activated 
 once again.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.5</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Fixed issue where the 
 current transition would not be reflected in the preview window while 
 using the arrow keys to navigate in the transition view window.</li>
	
	<li>Converted to support 
 <a href="../../Reference/NiMesh/NiMesh_Rel_Notes.htm">NiMesh</a> library.</li>
	
	<li>The cursor now switches 
 to "Wait" when the system is running up an animation. This most 
 commonly happens when the time scrubber is adjusted, or when a parameter 
 is adjusted while an animation is playing. </li>
	
	<li>Fixed issue in animation 
 system where removing or inserting a sequence into an asset would prevent 
 a KFM from loading. Sequences are now referenced by filename and sequence 
 name, rather than by index. AnimationTool now has additional dialogs to 
 support remapping missing sequences. This issue can still occur for older 
 version of KFMs. However, loading the KFM in AnimationTool and resaving 
 will update the KFM and prevent this issue.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.3.0.3</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Fixed a crash bug that 
 could occur when running the PhysX-enabled version of Animation Tool on 
 a machine without PhysX installed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.3.0</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Added support for <a 
 HREF="../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_PhysX_in_Animation_Tool.htm">physics 
 rag-doll preview and set-up</a>. The version of Animation Tool that ships 
 with Gamebryo includes this support using the PhysX simulation SDK. If 
 you don't have PhysX, you will see some interface elements that are non-functional.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a bug in <a href="../../Tools/animation_tool/Introduction_to_Animation_Tool.htm">Animation 
 Tool</a> that could cause sequence IDs to become changed in unintended 
 ways when tabbing between fields in the Sequence ID editor.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a crash bug that 
 arose when a project was saved to a disk volume other than the one it 
 was loaded from.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.1</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Fixed a bug where double 
 clicking on a KFM could result in a bad camera start position.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a bug where the 
 startup camera view is wrong when using the Y Axis as the default.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a bug where scenes 
 with zero bounds (or that only contained a single, sprite-based particle 
 system) could not be properly viewed or navigated.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Animation Tool's registry location has been changed to <span class="NDLSystemFont">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Emergent Game Technologies\AnimationTool</span>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Gamebryo 2.1.0</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>Fixed a bug when reloading 
 shaders that could result in an endless string of dialog boxes and then 
 a crash.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a bug where entering 
 the Interactive Preview mode could incorrectly mark the file as needing 
 to be saved.</li>
	
	<li>Loading pre-Gamebryo 
 1.2 KFM files that contained SET and MAP files was incorrectly marking 
 the file as needing to be saved. Now the file is only marked as such when 
 changes are made to it.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed a bug where clicking 
 a Chain transition in the Transitions View was incorrectly marking the 
 file as needing to be saved.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.0.0</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>An issue that was fixed 
 in the NiD3DXEffectShaderLib may also have fixed a difficult to reproduce 
 crash bug that would occur at startup of the Animation Tool. The bug seemed 
 to only occur in release builds and only for a few client machines.</li>
	
	<li>Added support for mass 
 editing for chain transitions. Users can now apply intermediate chains 
 to a number of chain transitions at once. In addition, they can mass convert 
 various transitions to a transition type, all of which have the same intermediate 
 chain stages.</li>
	
	<li>Added support for mass 
 editing of delayed blend transitions. Users can now applying blend pairs 
 to any number of selected delayed blend transitions.</li>
	
	<li>Added the ability to 
 un-select previously selected items from the Transition View.</li>
	
	<li>Added a warning for 
 when a KFM is loaded containing morphs with sequences having type CLAMP.</li>
	
	<li>Added a warning for 
 whenever the user attempts to change the transition type of a transition 
 to be a morph when one of the sequences in the transition has a cycle 
 type of CLAMP.</li>
	
	<li>Added a "Message 
 Box Manager" for advance users who wish to change the registry of 
 which message boxes to never display.</li>
	
	<li>Added to "Scene 
 Options" a button for setting the image subfolder to be the same 
 as the NIF.</li>
	
	<li>Added a feature where 
 the sequence group edit now persistently remembers the active sequences 
 as specified by the user.</li>
	
	<li>Increased conversion 
 times of transition types when performing mass conversions.</li>
	
	<li>Increased interactive 
 performance of the Transition's View drag feature. Drag selection no longer 
 updates the Edit View until the mouse button is released.</li>
	
	<li>Improved user prompt 
 when KFM needs saving. User now is prompted to save with Yes/No/Cancel 
 dialog. If Yes is chosen, a save file dialog now is presented so that 
 an alternate save file can be chosen if desired.</li>
	
	<li>The Edit View now auto-sizes 
 the Active Sequence list box based on the number of sequence items when 
 editing Sequence Groups.</li>
	
	<li>The Edit view now auto-sizes 
 the Chain list box based on the number of chain items when editing Chains</li>
	
	<li>The Edit view now auto-sizes 
 the Interactive Preview's sequences and Keystroke bindings...</li>
	
	<li>The Edit View now auto-sizes 
 the Blend-pair window.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed potential crash 
 bug that could occur when mass selecting transitions.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug where no 
 prompt to save work would occur if the applications "X" close 
 button was pressed.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed crash bug that 
 could occur if one of the tool assets could not be found.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug where editing 
 the "Image subfolder" of "Scene Options" would not 
 be restored when the user hits cancel.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug where if 
 renderer could not be created, it would attempt to re-create the renderer 
 over and over. Now it only tries once.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug where the 
 Project View would not sort correctly when loading a KFM with a missing 
 settings file.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug that would 
 cause a transition to hick-up during its animation if the sequences had 
 frequencies with values other than one.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed issue where sequences 
 that were renamed in the art packaged were not reflected in the Animation 
 Tool.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug where incorrect 
 morphing would occur if the sequences had only a single morph key.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug that occurred 
 while using the Render View. The bug involved the mouse cursor which normally 
 disappears while using the Render View, however under specific situations, 
 it would fail to reappear, leaving the application in a state without 
 a mouse pointer.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug where appending 
 sequences in the art package and then re-exporting (to a single KF) without 
 overwriting the KFM, would cause the Animation Tool to crash when trying 
 to load the KFM.</li>
	
	<li>Fixed bug where in 
 the "Add / Remove Sequences to Sequence Group" dialog box, removing 
 a sequence from the "Sequences in Group" list box replaces that 
 sequence to the end of the "Available Sequences" list box instead 
 or returning the sequence in its sorted order.</li>
	
	<li>Reduced number of message 
 boxes that are displayed when conversions are performed on multiple transitions.</li>
</ul>

<a name=Known_Issues_and_Limitations></a><h2>Known Issues 
 and Limitations</h2>

<h3>Functional Issues</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>When viewing transitions, 
 the application's time slider and playback control may not match the actual 
 time spent by the animations in every instance. The reason for this is 
 due to the fact that the time slider predicts how animations should theoretically 
 behave, but the animation system operates using real time. Because of 
 this, there are instances where a transition may finish just prior to 
 the end of a sequence or just after it has looped. Since the animation 
 will not finish until it reaches the end of the sequence, this can result 
 in an "extra" loop cycle or one less cycle, depending on where 
 the transition actually finishes. The behavior that you see in the render 
 view matches what you will see in the engine in your game.</li>
	
	<li>Selecting "Interactive 
 Preview" from the Project View with the mouse does not automatically 
 give keyboard focus to the edit view, preventing keystroke bindings from 
 taking effect. Click in the Edit View or Render View windows once the 
 Interactive Preview has been activated to begin driving the animations.</li>
	
	<li>Deleting any of the 
 files in the Application folder may cause the Animation Tool to crash 
 on startup. Do not delete any of these files.</li>
	
	<li>An out of sync .settings 
 file causes the user interface to be incorrect. If this occurs, delete 
 the .settings file and reopen the KFM.</li>
	
	<li>Sequences with a playback 
 mode of CLAMP may cause problems with blending for Morph and DefaultSync 
 transitions.</li>
	
	<li>If a controller has 
 keys that are looped in the source art package and the sequence time range 
 does not include the keys, the final value for the keys will be used throughout 
 the sequence instead of using the looped keyframes. This can be fixed 
 by manually looping the animation keyframes within the sequence time range.</li>
	
	<li>Particle system emitters 
 only use the highest weighted interpolator encountered by the <span class="NDLSystemFont"><a 
 HREF="../../Reference/NiAnimation/NiBlendInterpolator.htm">NiBlendInterpolator</a></span>. 
 If the highest weighted interpolator does not have active keys, no particles 
 will be emitted in that frame. This same limitation applies to the highest 
 weighted evaluator in sequence animation.</li>
	
	<li>If a dialog concerning 
 a CG function entry point (cgIsParameterUsed) missing appears when the 
 Animation Tool is first launched, it may be conflicting with a version 
 of CG that Maya is using. To resolve this, ensure that the correct path 
 to the CG sdk comes first in the PATH environment variable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physics-Specific Issues</h3>

<p>See the <a href="../../Tools/animation_tool/Tips_for_Physics_in_Animation_Tool.htm">Tips 
 for Physics in Animation Tool</a> page for additional information on these 
 issues.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The PhysX data is not loaded when you right click on "Character Model" and
        choose "Select Model" to load your NIF.</li>
	
	<li>Secondary physics may 
 behave badly when animations begin in poses that differ from the bind 
 pose. To avoid this problem, set
 the <a HREF="../../Reference/Tool_Plug_ins/PhysX_Extractor.htm">PhysX 
 Extractor</a> options to extract "Initial States from Sequences".</li>
	
	<li>Physical sequences 
 cannot reliably be included in Sequence Groups.</li>
	
	<li>The interface may appear 
 to freeze when a parameter is modified and a physical sequence is playing. 
 This occurs, for example, when a transition to physics is playing in preview 
 and the transition duration or type is changed. The application has not 
 frozen - it is taking a long time to simulate the physics from the beginning 
 of the sequence up to the time-slider location. You should see an hourglass 
 cursor when PhysX is catching up.</li>
	
	<li>Physics transitions 
 that take place at the same time as an animation loops can cause extreme, 
 unintended behaviors.</li>
	
	<li>Delayed Blend transitions 
 do not work from physical sequences because the end frame is ill-defined.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minor Interface Issues</h3>

<ul>
	
	<li>The Output View window, 
 which color codes messages by type, initially colors messages black upon 
 start up. The color coding is fixed after viewing another message channel.</li>
	
	<li>If the model NIF file 
 contains animations that were not extracted into sequences, those animations 
 will playback in the Animation Tool regardless of what sequence is selected.</li>
	
	<li>The Keystroke Settings 
 horizontal scroll bar may not function properly on some machine configurations. 
 If this occurs, drag the size bar at the bottom to resize the control. 
 This should cause the scroll bar to work.</li>
	
	<li>The TransitionsViewForm.cs 
 file cannot be viewed in Visual Studio using Designer View. Only the code 
 for this class can be viewed. Double-clicking on this file to view it 
 in Designer View may cause an assertion failure or otherwise fail to display 
 properly.</li>
</ul>
