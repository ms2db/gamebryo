<h1>Introduction to PhysX in Animation Tool</h1>

<p>The PhysX-enabled version of Animation Tool supports 
 physics preview in the tool as animations are playing. This allows you 
 to preview blends and transitions between animated control and physical 
 control, and allows you to see how secondary physical objects, such as 
 a cape, move while the character is animated.</p>

<p>This guide includes the following pages:</p>

<ul>
	
	<li>We give an overview 
 of how to <a href="Working_With_Physical_Sequences_in_Animation_Tool.htm">manipulate 
 and interact with physical sequences</a> in Animation Tool.</li>
	
	<li>The <a HREF="Physics_View_in_Animation_Tool.htm">Physics 
 View</a> is a control panel for physics in Animation Tool. It allows users 
 to specify which sequences are physically controlled and to define the 
 parameters of the underlying physics simulation.</li>
	
	<li>The <a HREF="Physical_Forces_in_Animation_Tool.htm">Physical 
 Forces</a> page describes the force interface and how it works when an 
 animation is playing.</li>
	
	<li>A <a HREF="Tips_for_Physics_in_Animation_Tool.htm">tips</a> 
 page provides many useful recommendation for achieving better performance 
 and a smoother work-flow. It includes known issues and things to avoid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Samples</h2>

<p>The directory <span class="NDLSystemFont"><em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\Samples\Models\AnimationToolExamples\Slim</span> 
 in the Gamebryo installation contains an example of a physical model and 
 Animation Tool settings. You can also look at the Slim character model 
 from the <a HREF="../../Learn/FullDemos/Dodgeball_Overview.htm">DodgeBall</a> 
 sample, which differs in its use of accumulation.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>Support for physics preview requires the PhysX system 
 installed on your machine, and only works with models that were exported 
 with PhysX properties associated with them. Some parts of the physics 
 interface will be visible but disabled if you do not have PhysX installed.</p>

<p>The version that ships in the Gamebryo installers has 
 PhysX enabled. Support for PhysX is optional when the Animation Tool is 
 rebuilt from source code, and build configurations exist that do not use 
 PhysX. Note that a non-PhysX build will have a different executable name 
 so that studios can use both versions simultaneously if necessary.</p>

<p>If your studio works with a different physics system, 
 there is a good chance you can use the PhysX integration with Animation 
 Tool as a template for integrating your preferred physics system.</p>
