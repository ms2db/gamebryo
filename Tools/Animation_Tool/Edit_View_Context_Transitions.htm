<h1>Edit View: Transitions Context</h1>

<p>The actions that you can perform in the Edit View change depending on the type of object that is active in the Animation Tool. A brief discussion of what you can do in the Edit View when you are editing transitions follows.</p>

<h4>Delayed Blend</h4>


	<p>You can edit the duration of the blend. You can also create new blend pairs from existing text keys. To do this, you use the two combo boxes in the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Create New Blend Pair</span> section of the Edit View. Within this same section, you can delete existing blend pairs.</p>
 
   <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">Using the Transitions View, it is possible to select multiple Delayed Blend 
 type transitions at one time. When this happens, if no other transition 
 types are selected in the mix, the user is allowed to edit all the Delayed 
 Blend types all at once. The Blend Pairs section will only show Blend 
 Pairs that are common to all the Delayed Blend transitions selected. Also, 
 the user will only be allowed to add new Blend Pairs that are capable 
 of being added to each and every Delayed Blend type selected.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>
 
 
<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/EditView-DelayedBlend.jpg" width="300" height="466" />
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit View for Delayed Blend</p>
</div>

<h4>Immediate Blend</h4>


<p>Immediate blends are like their delayed blend counterparts except they do not have any of the blend pair controls. Instead, you can only choose a transition duration and a text key that indicates the frame in the destination to blend to.</p>
 
  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">When multiple Immediate Blend transitions are selected, only Durations may be edited.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

<h4>Morph and Cross Fade</h4>


<p>You can specify the duration of the transition for morphs (synchronized) and cross fades (unsynchronized).</p>
 
  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">When multiple Morph or Cross Fade transitions are selected, the Duration may be edited and the result is applied to all the selected transitions.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

<h4>Default Sync and Default NonSync</h4>


<p>When you edit Default Sync and Default NonSync transitions, you can use the Edit View to change default settings and you can make the transition "unique". Making a default transition unique will change its type to be the actual type indicated by the default. For example, if Default NonSync transitions are set to be a cross fade, making a Default NonSync transition unique will change the transition type to Cross Fade. You can only modify duration for unique transitions.</p>
 
   <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">When multiple Default Sync or Default NonSync transitions are selected, they may all be made unique.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>

<h4>Chain</h4>

<p>	When you edit a chain transition, you can specify the length of each transition in the chain. Click a sequence in the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Chain Sequence</span> listbox and then set the transition duration in the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Selected Sequence</span> section of the Edit View. The duration that you specify is the amount of time that the animation system will wait after the previous transition is complete to trigger the next transition in the chain. The default duration is set to wait until the end of the current sequence before transitioning to the next sequence in the chain, but the duration can also be specified in seconds.Each transition in the chain uses the settings stored in the project to transition from the current sequence to the next sequence in the chain.</p>
 

	  <table class="NDLNoteContainer" width="100%">
      <tr align="left">
          <td class="NDLNoteContainerTD"><p class="NDLHeadingNoteContainer">Note</p>
              <div class="NDLNote">Using the Transitions View, it is possible to select multiple Chain type transitions at one time. If no other transition types are selected other than Chains, the user will be allowed to edit all of the Chains at once.
              </div>
          </td>
      </tr>
  </table>


	<p>The <span class="NDLGUILabel">Chain Sequence</span> section will only show 
 intermediate chains that are common (starting from the end of the chain) 
 to all the selected chains. If any intermediates differ, the Chain Sequence 
 will display <span class="NDLGUILabel">&lt;INTERMEDIATES DIFFER&gt;</span> followed by the common ones. <span class="NDLGUILabel">&lt;Multiple Sources&gt;</span> and <span class="NDLGUILabel">&lt;Multiple Destinations&gt;</span> will display if the source or destination sequences are different among the selected.</p>
 
<p>If intermediates are in common and they share the same durations, the duration will display within parentheses next to the intermediate. You can modify the durations in one operation by selecting the intermediate. If intermediates are in common but their durations different, <span class="NDLGUILabel">(DURATIONS DIFFER)</span> will display, and you will not be able to modify all of the durations in one operation.</p>
 
<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="./images/EditView-Chain.jpg" width="300" height="493" />
    	<p class="FigureCaption">Edit View for Chain</p>
</div>

<p>The Edit View isn't completely sufficient for real-time editing of chains. You can click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Edit Chain</span> button to open the Edit Chain dialog. On the right side of this dialog, you can review the intermediate sequences between the source and destination sequences of the chain. You can also filter the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Possible Next Sequences</span> list using the two radio buttons at the bottom of the list. If you use this dialog to edit multiple chains in one operation, you can add and delete common intermediates. If chains have intermediates that differ, <span class="NDLGUILabel">&lt;INTERMEDIATES DIFFER&gt;</span> displays, followed by a list of all the common intermediates, if any.</p>
