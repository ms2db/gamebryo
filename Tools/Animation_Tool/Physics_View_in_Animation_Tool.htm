<h1>Physics View</h1>

<p>You can use the Physics View in the Animation Tool to specify forces that you want to exert on objects while they are simulating. The forces are saved and re-applied every time the simulation restarts. This enables you to apply a force and then change the view to see from various angles how the object behaves under the force.</p>

<p>To display this view, select <span class="NDLGUILabel">View > Physics View</span> or click the <span class="NDLGUILabel">Physics View</span> button on the main toolbar.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">

</div>
 
<p>While the Physics View is visible, you can float it, add it to a tab group, or dock it within the Animation Tool interface. Values that you specify in the Physics View are saved with the settings file for the current project and are available when the project is reloaded.</p>

		<tr>
			<td>Physical Sequences</td>
			<td>View and/or select sequences that are currently under physics control. When one of these sequences is animating, physics-derived values are written to the sequence's pose buffer. This pose buffer data is blended with other active sequences before the final result is propagated to the scene graph.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Add/Remove</td>
			<td>Open a dialog box in which you can add or remove physical sequences</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Apply Forces</td>
			<td>Control force exertion while the animation is playing. This toggle button is part of the group that controls the Render View's response to mouse input (like the Orbit, Pan and Ground height buttons). When this button is selected, mouse input is interpreted as applying a force.</td>

			<td>Clear</td>
			<td>Clear force from memory.</td>

			<td>Strength</td>
			<td>Control the strength of the force.</td>

			<td>Ground Plane Friction</td>
			<td>Define the amount of friction on the ground plane.
			<div class="NDLTDNote"><span class="NDLTableNote">Note:</span> There is a physical ground plane in the same location as the rendered 
 ground plane. The friction and bounce values interact with the friction 
 and bounce of the model that is being simulated - the default is for the 
 collision to have the average of the two values. Hence, doubling the bounce 
 or friction of the ground may not double the apparent bounce or friction.</div>

			<td>Timestep</td>
			<td>Set the step size used by the underlying physics simulation. For stable simulation, the value should be kept within a tight range; between 0.05 down and 0.005 works best. Use smaller steps for faster or heavier objects.</td>
