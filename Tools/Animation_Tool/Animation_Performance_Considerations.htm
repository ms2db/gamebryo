<h1>Animation Performance Considerations</h1>

<p>Though the Animation Tool can give you a basic idea of the expense behind adding multiple animations, it is not intended to be used as a performance testing application.</p>

<p>The animation system will attempt to optimize the performance when blending multiple animations together. It is still desirable to minimize the number of simultaneous sequences active on a character at any point in time. For instance, if you want to represent the spectrum of animations between shooting left and right, it is sometimes possible to only use two animations instead of three (shoot left, shoot right, shoot forward). This largely depends on how the sequences were constructed. In most cases, animation blending is a balancing act between the number of sequences necessary to make a visually appealing blend and the number of sequences budgeted for efficient performance. </p>

<p>Gamebryo ships with the CharacterPerformanceDemo, which is an application that serves as a powerful testbed for animated character performance. Within this demo, you can specify a KFM file and add multiple independent copies of that character running simultaneously.</p>
