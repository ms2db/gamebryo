  <h1>World Builder Key Terms</h1>

  <p>Before continuing with World Builder it is recommended that you first read over
    the introduction documentation for the <a href="../EntityModelingTool/emt_intro.htm">Entity
    Modeling Tool</a>.</p>

  <h2>Entity Instance - &quot;Entity&quot;</h2>
  <p>Entities are instances of the entity models embodied in a simulator. The Game Framework
  documentation includes a thorough discussion of
  <a href="../../Programmer/Entities/entity_intro.htm">Working with entities</a>. As the game
  simulation evolves, the entities will respond to events within the simulation.</p>

  <h2>Block and Layer Files</h2>
  <p>Block and layer files are tools-only file formats for defining initial conditions for a game
  simulation. These files are simple text XML files for ease of merging and authoring. Entity
  instances defined within these files only contain property values that are overridden from their
  parent entity models. 
  
See the 
<a href="wb_block_layer_intro.htm">
Working with Blocks and Layers Introduction
</a> for more information.

      </p>

  <h2>XBlock Files</h2>
  <p>XBlock files are a runtime-only files for defining initial conditions for a game
  simulation. XBlock files are generated by collapsing block and layer files into a single file
  format in the export process. Xblock files are simple text XML files.</p>
  
  <h2>Palette</h2>
  <p>The World Builder palette consist of all instantiable (non-abstract) models and 
      presets that are defined in any referenced EMT projects. The palette allows you 
      to instantiate entities into the world. For more information, see the 
      documentation on   <a href="wb_ref_palette_view.htm">World Builder Palette View</a>.
  
  </p>

  <h2>Viewports</h2>
  <p>Viewports in World Builder present the graphical representations of the world under 
      construction.</p>

  <h2>Gizmos</h2>
  <p>Gizmos provide a means of interacting with viewports to accomplish 
      various task. There are several gizmos, but the most common are the ones that 
      allow a user to select, move, rotate, and scale entities.&nbsp; </p>

  <h2>Camera Tools and Modes</h2>
  <p>Camera Tools and Modes provide a means of altering the views that viewports provide. In
  other words, they provide basic navigation capabilities such a being able to fly around, 
  orbit entities, face toward selections, pan the camera, and what not. See the documentation 
  <a href="wb_world_camera_navigation.htm">Navigating Around the World</a> for more information.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Selection Sets</h2>
  <p>Selection Sets are a named group of assets that are bundled together for ease of 
      selection. See the 
      <a href="wb_ref_selection_set_editor.htm">Selection Set Editor</a> reference documentation
      for more information.
  </p>
  
  
  <h2>
      Synchronizing Content</h2>
  <p>Synchronizing content is the process by which the World Builder's world is 
      brought into sync with the models defined by EMT and the world used by the game. 
      Synchronizing to the game amounts to exporting out the current state of the world 
      while synchronizing from EMT amounts to updating World Builder's in-memory 
      representations of models and presets. See 
      <a href="wb_world_game_synchronization.htm">Synchronizing Content with the Game</a>
      and 
      <a href="wb_world_emtproj_synchronization.htm">Synchronizing Content with Entity Modeling Tool</a>
       for more information.</p>
