<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a><h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Terrain may now be created and edited inside World Builder. See the 
       <a href="../WorldBuilderTerrain/wbt_artist_guide.htm">World Builder Terrain Artist Guide</a> 
       for more information.</li>
    <li>Environment and Time Of Day features are new in this release. Please view 
    <a href="../EnvironmentToD/etod_intro.htm">Environment and Time Of Day Introduction</a> 
    for more information. </li>
    <li>Layers can now be unloaded to save memory when working on large worlds. Please see
        <a href="wb_block_layer_loadunload.htm">Loading and Unloading Layers</a> for details.</li>   
    <li>Assets can be dragged and dropped from Windows Explorer directly into a world to <a href="wb_entity_creation.htm">create entities</a> without relying on the Palette View.</li>
    <li>The Entity Editor UI has been reworked for better performance and usability. There are new sorting and filtering options for working with properties.</li>
    <li>The Test Content feature now accounts for blocks that include independently exported layers.</li>
    <li>The gizmo system has been reworked so that gizmos are now reusable components that can be
    repurposed via a new adapter concept.</li>
    <li>There are new actions for moving forward and backward through the entity selection history.
    These actions can be assigned shortcut keys via the Utilities | Shortcuts editor.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The ConvertLLIDRefs upgrade tool has been updated to also affect .layer files.</li>
    <li>World Builder can now be used to create whiteboxes. See <a href="wb_entity_whiteboxing.htm">Working with Whiteboxes</a> for more information
        on authoring whiteboxes and <a href="..\..\Programmer\CoreRuntimeServices\core_services_egmWhitebox.htm">The egmWhitebox Library</a> for
        runtime service information.</li>
    <li>Users can now export their entities to FBX files. See <a href="wb_entity_export_to_DCC.htm">Exporting Entities to DCC Tools</a> for details.</li>
    <li>World Builder now has defaults for movement speeds, grid sizes and a snap radius comparable to a meter scale world. The previous defaults were all 
    for a centimeter scale world, so there are some things to be aware of: 
        <ul>
            <li>Your current user settings may need to be changed for movement speed in World Builder. Failure to change these will cause your movement 
            speeds to likely be very fast.</li>
            <li>Make sure to also check default grid sizes and snap radius as well. In both cases, if you right click on a setting in Toolbench's 
            settings editor there is an option to reset just that one property to its default value.</li>
            <li>There is a per-block setting called World Scale. It can be found in your settings for a block under the "World" group.  This existing setting 
            has more meaning than it used to in 3.1. It is now being used to scale the grid sizes to match your world.  It will also be used to scale proxies 
            in the world. Previously, it was only used to scale movement speeds. This scale value represents your world's scale compared to a meter scale world, 
            if inserted into that world. So, for example, if you author your art at a centimeter scale your art would be 100 times larger than the same art modeled 
            at meter scale. So ,your World Scale would need to be 100.</li>
            <li>There is a new Model in the standard model library called "Proxy" which both 2DProxy and 3DProxy mix in, which contains a property called ProxyScale. 
            This new property allows you to define the proxy's scale to convert it to a meter scale world. For example, the light proxies we use in World Builder were 
            authored at a centimeter scale. The Light models now have a ProxyScale value of 0.01. Because they need to be scaled down to work in a meter scale world. This 
            ProxyScale value is multiplied by the World Scale to arrive at the actual rendered scale of the proxy art in a given environment. So if I were to insert a 
            light proxy with a 0.01 proxy scale, into Hello World which has a World Scale of 100. The final scale would be 1, since both the proxy and the art in the 
            world are both at a centimeter scale. If I were to insert a light into Alpha Game, or Day Dreamer which were authored at meter scale and have a World Scale 
            of 1. The light proxy's final scale would be 0.01 and would then appear the same relative size as it would in a centimeter scale world, in a meter scale world.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>
<ul>
    <li>A new <a href="wb_ref_palette_view.htm">Palette View</a> replaces the Palette View in the previous version of Gamebryo LightSpeed.
        This new view improves usability for larger sets of models and presets. In Browse mode, items are displayed in the same folder hierarchy
        specified in the EMT Project Explorer. In Search mode, items can be quickly queried. Folder contents or search results can be displayed
        in details or thumbnails mode.</li>
    <li>Direct3D 10 rendering can be enabled in World Builder via the "Preferred D3D Version" user setting under World Builder \ Renderer.</li>
	<li>Point and spot lights now use a different property visualizer which renders
	a circle around the area where the light contribution is above a certain
	threshold. </li>
    <li>Using the context menu, viewports can be configured to move and view through scene cameras.
        Hit Esc to exit this mode and update camera entity properties.</li>
    <li>Using the World Builder menu, camera entities can be created based on the current viewport.</li>
    <li>The active viewport can be toggled to a maximized state.</li>
    <li>A significant memory leak in the Entity Editor was removed.
        Several performance improvements have also been made to this editor.</li>
    <li>The Layer Editor has been rewritten in WPF. The functionality should remain the 
        same.</li>
    <li>Users can now override how their block and layer files can be exported. Please 
        see <a href="wb_block_layer_export.htm">Exporting blocks/layers</a> for details.</li>
    <li>Layer operations are now grouped into atomic undo/redo actions.</li>
    <li>The marquee selection is considerably more accurate.  Now instead of testing
        against bounding volumes for all entities, it will test against the geometry
        of static entities and the bone bounding volumes for animated entities.</li>
    <li>Added new marquee selection options - Additive, Subtractive, and Intersection.</li>
    <li>Various fixes were applied to Creation Mode: created entities no longer always
        get created at the origin, they start with their default orientation, and the
        Global trait is respected.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue in the folder pane of the Entity View so that selecting
        a folder would not lose the user's selection.</li>
    <li>In the Entity View's folder pane, the counts next to each folder are
        accurate and there's a tooltip describing what each number means.</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue where placing an entity would sometimes place the entity
        behind the camera.</li>
    <li>Added the ability to filter properties displayed in the Entity Editor. The new Summary property trait can be used to control some filters.</li>
    <li>The Entity Editor now lists base model properties first.</li>
    <li>Properties with the Hidden trait are now hidden in the Entity Editor even if overridden.</li>
    <li>The Model restriction on EntityRef List and EntityRef Map properties is now properly enforced.</li>
    <li>The EMT-WB synchronization prompt will appear more reliably when relevant changes have occurred.</li>
    <li>Fixed a crash upon syncing after removing a mixin from an entity model and then adding
        a new mixin.</li>
    <li>The palette now has a command for editing the selected model or preset in EMT.</li>
    <li>Custom shader support in World Builder has been fixed.</li>
    <li>The game solution is no longer marked dirty when toggling a World Builder layer's lock or hidden state.</li>
    <li>Only one instance of the Randomizer tool can be opened.</li>
    <li>Greatly increased default Snap Points tolerance to 50 units.</li>
    <li>Attempting to create a duplicate selection set will now override the existing set. This action can be undone if necessary.</li>
    <li>Xblock files are written to disk only if there are actual changes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>World Builder is a new tool. See the <a href="wb_intro.htm">World Builder documentation</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a><h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>

<h3>All Gamebryo LightSpeed Releases</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Some changes to the AttachedObjects map of an entity that mixes in Actor or Mesh,
    or any property of type AttachedNifAsset, are
    not reflected in the viewport when animation is turned off. Specifically, changes
    to the Translation, Rotation and Scaling sub-properties of an AttachedNifAsset-type property
    do not update the rendered geometry. Applying
    some other update, such as translating or rotating the entity, will cause the entity's
    attachments to update too, as will having animations active. Furthermore, removing
    one of the entries in the map is not updated on an entity. The only way to remove
    an entry from the AttachedObjects map is to create a new entity model, mix in the
    existing entity model, and then remove the AttachedObjects map entry
    in the Entity Modeling Tool.</li>

  <li>With lights having very large values for their Range property (upward of 10^5), 
	having property visualizers enabled can cause the camera
	frustum to stretch too far, causing the visible scene to clip incorrectly.</li>
  <li>3D and 2D proxies are unlit and so the art for them needs to be emissive.</li>
  <li>For the World Builder entity view, we use a modified version of WPFToolkit&#39;s 
    DataGrid for the group by model layout.&nbsp; The source code has not been 
    included, but can be downloaded from here 
    (http://wpf.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=25047).&nbsp; If 
    you need to make further changes to the source code, you should read the 
    detailed information about the change contained in the following readme 
    (Source\Tools\Toolbench\Plugins\Emergent.Toolbench.WorldBuilder.UI\References\WPF 
    Toolkit\v3.5.40320.1\Readme.txt).</li>
  <li>If an model has a map-valued property (also list, since they are implemented 
    using maps), entities created at runtime from that model will ALWAYS have the 
    map keys from the flat models, plus whatever additional keys have been added to 
    the entity in World Builder.&nbsp; Note, that the property editor does not 
    prevent the user from removing keys in the entity editor that come from the 
    model.&nbsp; Example; if the flat model specified keys A, B, and C, and the user 
    edits the entity and removes A &amp; B and adds key D, then the user should rightly 
    expect that the entity at runtime will only have keys C &amp; D, but in fact the 
    entity will have A, B, C, &amp; D; but the World Builder property editor does not 
    reflect this behavior.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>
    Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>For very large terrains the view port camera's far plane may clip the visible
      terrain. This is due to the way the far plane of the camera is automatically computed
      within Toolbench. To resolve this issue, place entities at the extreme edges of
      the terrain. </li>
    <li>Be aware that editing large, detailed terrains can consume a great deal of memory.
       Terrain sectors and entity layers can be unloaded to manage memeory use. If Toolbench
       crashes due to running out of memory, it may be necessary to manually kill the process in
       Task Manager (or by rebooting) in order to restart Toolbench.</li>
    <li>Some less common terrain and environment operations are not well supported by the undo
    system. For example, creating or deleting new terrain sectors is not undoable. In some such
    situations, the undo stack may be cleared to maintain stability. Typical workflow like terrain
    height editing and material painting are fully supported.</li>
    <li>A Time Of Day file can only be created for a single object. It can however be
      reused in other blocks as long as the content is not changed. </li>
    <li>Modifying custom Time Of Day entities can be costly as the default Time Of Day
      framework uses messaging to update changes. When creating a custom Time Of Day editable
      object, the implementation of a custom TimeOfDayFunctor might be required (refer
      to <a href="../../Programmer/NiEnvironment/TimeOfDay_Object.htm">
       Time Of Day Object</a>class for more information) </li>
    <li>There can be only one Environment and Time Of Day entity instanced from a specific model.
    </li>
    <li>The Time Of Day editor only supports floats and colors (both Color and ColorA).</li>
    <li>The Environment tools are limited to a default skybox with only one blend stage
      (fog). </li>
  </ul>
