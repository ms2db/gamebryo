<h1>World Builder Layer Basics</h1>

<p>A layer is an added scene file, containing its own entities,
that is included in a primary block file.  Layers serve to
break up a scene into multiple files that are combined together.</p>

<p>The primary use of layers is to facilitate multiple user
support. In the past, levels were made up of one file that might
be passed around from one person to another, allowing for only
one person to put content directly into a level at a time. Breaking up a scene
into layers allows multiple people to be working
within their own layer file and contributing to the overall
scene creation at the same time.</p>

<p>Layers are additional files that are loaded into the
master file (the primary block file). Scenes will have a different number of layers
depending on how the people responsible for the level choose to
break the level up. Since layers are essentially level files,
they can contain any number of different types of objects. While
many will be specialized, some could contain geometry, script
objects, and scripts, while another just contains lights.</p>

<p>Layers can even overlap the same physical space. One layer
might be responsible for the geometry of a room, while another
contains the lighting for that room, and yet another contains the
spawn points for that room.  However, this need not be the case: a different
layer could be used to store everything in each quadrant of a scene, for instance.
How layers break up the scene is completely up to the developer.</p>

<p>It should be noted that layers do not modify the way entities interact in a scene
and are a tool abstraction only.  Lights in one layer will affect objects in another
layer, and objects in any layer can snap to objects in any other layer.</p>

<p>Objects can not exist in more than one layer or in a layer and
the primary scene file. </p>

<h3>Primary Block File</h3>

<p>A primary block file is the "master" file of the scene. It
controls what layer files make up the scene. The master file is
the file that will be called to load when changing to a new level
or scene. The master file will then load all of its needed
layers. Primary scene files will usually be empty containing
little to no objects. The primary scene file is always the root
of the layer editor tree.</p>

<p>When editing a scene, users will commonly open the master file
and edit only their particular layer to visually see the entire
scene.</p>

<h3>Layers</h3>

<p>A layer contains a set of entities, where each entity belongs to
one and only one layer.  It can belong to the primary block file
or to another layer. It is saved in a <em>.layer</em>
file.</p>

<h3>Current Layer</h3>

<p>The current layer is the layer into which all new entities or
new layers will be added. Cloned entities will also be created in
the current layer, not in the layer of the entity being cloned.
There can only be only layer active at
a time and it must always be a writable layer. If there are no
writable layers then there will be no current layer. You may
change the current layer by right clicking on a writable layer
and selecting "Set as Current". When first loaded, the root layer
is the current layer if it is writable.</p>
