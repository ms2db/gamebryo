<h1>World Builder - Palette View</h1>

<p>The Palette View allows access to all non-abstract entity models and presets defined in any
referenced EMT project. By default, it is visible in a left-docked pane when a block file is opened
into World Builder.</p>

<p>Entity models and presets can be dragged from this view and dropped into the World Builder
viewport to create new entities.</p>

<p>A thumbnail image and description for the selected content is displayed at the bottom of the
view.</p>

<p>The view has two modes for finding palette content. They operate similarly to how Windows
Explorer works with the file system.</p>

<h2>Browse Mode</h2>

<p>The Browse tab is used for navigating a virtual folder hierarchy of entity models and presets.
This may be done exclusively in the Contents sub-pane to conserve screen space. Alternatively, the
Folders sub-pane can be added on the left for greater flexibility. There is a draggable splitter
between the two sub-panes to specify how the space should be shared. The content hierarchy viewed
here is created and edited in the EMT Project Explorer within the Entity Modeling Tool.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/palette_view_browse.png" alt=
    "Palette View - Browse mode (27K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Palette View - Browse mode</p>
</div>

<p>The root of the hierarchy contains read-only links to all EMT projects referenced by the open
block file. Within these projects are entity models, presets, and virtual folders. Virtual folders
can in turn contain additional EMT content, including virtual subfolders. Project references are
managed in the Game Solution view.</p>

<p>There are several controls for navigating the content hierarchy in Browse Mode.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the Location breadcrumb control at the top of the pane to quickly move between folders
    and referenced EMT projects.</li>

    <li>Use the Filter edit box to specify a substring that limits the display of items at the
    current level in the hierarchy.</li>

    <li>Use the Folders sub-pane to expand, collapse, and view different folders and projects.</li>

    <li>Double-click folders in the Contents sub-pane to navigate into them.</li>

    <li>Use the backspace key to navigate up one level in the virtual hierarchy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Search Mode</h2>

<p>The Search tab is used to quickly locate palette content that might be scattered throughout
multiple referenced EMT projects. The query-building controls provide several different criteria
for searches. Matching entity models and presets are returned in the Results list.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/palette_view_search.png" alt=
    "Palette View - Search mode (45K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Palette View - Search mode</p>
</div>

<p>A checkbox to the left of each option determines which search criteria are active. The Advanced
rollout can be expanded for access to additional search options. The Execute Query button performs
the search. If the Palette View has focus, simply hitting the enter key will also perform the
search. The following search parameters can be specified.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Search Parameter</th>

            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Search Under</td>

            <td>Specify an EMT project to search, or uncheck to search all referenced
            projects.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Name Includes</td>

            <td>Specify a substring to find in model and preset names.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Has Mixin</td>

            <td>Specify a model name substring that must be mixed in.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Has Property</td>

            <td>Specify a property name substring that must be present.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Has Behavior</td>

            <td>Specify a behavior name substring that must be present.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>Results are listed with Name and Virtual Path. The path reflects the EMT project and virtual
folders that contain an item.</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>Palette items listed in both Browse and Search tabs provide context menus with a variety of
commands. The available commands depend on the type and context of content selected.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Command</th>

            <th>Details</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Edit</td>

            <td>Opens the selected entity model or preset in the Entity Modeling Tool, where it can
            be edited.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Transmogrify</td>

            <td>Converts all selected entities to use the selected entity model or preset from the
            Palette View.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>View Asset</td>

            <td>Opens an external tool for viewing the NIF or KFM asset associated with the
            selected entity model or preset. This feature is configured in user settings.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <td>Browse to Location</td>

            <td>When used in Search Mode, this command will transition the view to Browse mode,
            arriving at the virtual path of the selected item.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Thumbnails View</h2>

<p>Each mode of Palette View can be configured to use either of two visualizations. These
visualizations are toggled via the Views dropdown. The default visualization is Details.</p>

<p>Thumbnails view can be useful for quickly locating entity models and presets that have
associated visual assets.</p>

<div class="FigureContainer">
    <img src="images/palette_view_thumbnails.png" alt=
    "Thumbnails View (47K)">

    <p class="FigureCaption">Palette View - Thumbnails View</p>
</div>

<p>The Zoom slider controls the size of the thumbnail images, trading image detail for viewable
image count. Hovering over the label for a thumbnail will display a tooltip with the full name and
virtual path of the item.</p>

<p>The thumbnails are provided via the <a href=
"../NiThumbnailExtractor/NiThumbnailExtractor_Intro.htm">NiThumbnailExtractor COM DLL</a>.</p>
