  <h1>World Builder Entity View</h1>

  <p>The entity view is the primary mechanism users will use to navigate the entities in their
  block.  Because users will be interested in different aspects of the data depending on what they
  are doing, there are three separate layouts in the entity view; folder, alphabetical and
  model layout.</p>

  <h2>Folder Layout</h2>

  <p>The folder view displays the folder information contained in the block files.  The list of
  folders is displayed in the top pane with the list of entities and folders in that folder
  contained in the bottom pane.  Users are free to drag the entities and folders around and drop
  them into a different folder of their choosing.</p>

  <p>The numbers beside each folder represent the following (in order):
  <ul>
  <li>The number of entities in the folder with the filter applied.</li>
  <li>The number of entities contained in the folder.</li>
  <li>The number of entities contained in the folder and all of its descendant folders.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

  </p>

  <p>Right-clicking a folder in the Folder Layout presents a context menu with the following options:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add Folder - Create a new folder.</li>
    <li>Remove Folder - Deletes the selected folder.</li>
    <li>Rename Folder - Allows the user to rename the selected folder.</li>
    <li>Add Selection - Adds all selected entities in the scene into the selected folder.</li>
    <li>Select All - Selects all entities in the selected folder and all subfolders.</li>
    <li>Select All in Folder - Selects all entities in the selected folder only.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Alphabetical Layout</h2>

  <p>The alphabetical layout displays all the entities sorted alphabetically by their name.</p>

  <h2>Model Layout</h2>

  <p>The model layout shows all the entities in a block file broken up into groups based on the
  entity model that the entity was instantiated from.</p>

  <h2>Filtering</h2>

  <p>Filtering is performed by typing an entity name to search for in the search input field at
  the top.  The displayed list will be trimmed in real-time as you type.  To remove the filter just
  erase the text or hit the clear button.  All searching is performed using a substring match on
  the entity name.</p>

  <h2>Picking</h2>

  <p>When using the EntityRef property editor, it is valid to pick an entity in the
    scene as well as from any entity contained in any of the entity layouts in these
    views.</p>
