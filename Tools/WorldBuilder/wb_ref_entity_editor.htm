  <h1>World Builder - Entity Editor</h1>

  <p>The entity editor in World Builder allows users to modify the property values of each entity
  in the block file.  The editor supports single or multiple selection and it also allows the user
  to lock or hide the selected entities.</p>

  <h2>Single Entity Editor</h2>

  <p><img src="images/EntityEditorView.png" /></p>

  <p>The single entity editor shows each visible property exposed by the entity and allows the user
  to edit each value constrained by any restrictions that were assigned to the property in EMT.
  In addition to the properties the user can also edit the name, description, layer containing
  the entity and also view the model or preset that the entity derives from.  The checkbox
  represents properties that have been overridden from the default value inherited from their base
  model type.</p>
  
  <p>A toolstrip and edit box permit organizing and filtering the properties displayed. For example,
  the view can be restricted to show only overridden properties or only properties flagged with the
  Summary trait in EMT. This can help reduce clutter in the editor by showing the most commonly used
  properties.</p>

  <h2>Multiple Selected Entity Editor</h2>

  <p><img src="images/EntityEditorMultiView.png" /></p>

  <p>The multiple entity editor will appear as soon as two or more entities are selected in
  World Builder.  The multiple entity editor does not allow modifying anything other than the
  properties for the selected entities. The displayed list of properties that appears is neither the
  union nor intersection of the common properties shared by the selected entities.  It is actually
  all the properties shared by at least two of the entities that are selected.  That way if a group
  of trees are selected along with some rocks accidentally, you can still modify the properties
  specific to the trees.  The checkbox represents overridden properties that differ from their base
  model, the tri-state checkbox is used if the selected entities differ on the overridden state of a
  property.</p>

  <p>Properties with a blue background represent properties that at least two of the
    selected entities differ on and will display the default value for the property type.</p>

  <h3>Entity Options</h3>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>
          Icon
        </th>
        <th>
          Name

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>

        </td>
        <td>
          Hidden|Visible|Mixed</td>
        <td>
          The Show/Hide button allows the user to control the tool-time visibility of the selected
          entities.  Hidden entities will not be able to be picked in the scene, to select them
          again the user will need to select the entity from the entity view.  Any hidden flags set
          on the layer containing the entity will take presidence over this setting, but will not
          replace or reset the value here.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <img src="images/Locked.png" />
        </td>
        <td>
          Unlocked|Locked|Mixed</td>
        <td>
          The Lock/Unlock button allows the user to control the tool-time frozen nature of the
          selected entities.  Locked entities appear in the rendered view, but will not be able to
          be picked in the scene, to select them again the user will need to select the entity
          from the entity view.  Any locked flags set on the layer containing the entity will take
          presidence over this setting, but will not replace or reset the value here.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <h3>Property Format Error</h3>

  <p>Any property values that are not formatted correctly by the user will display the following
  error message.  Property values that are not formatted correctly will not be saved to the file
  or be sent to the underlying framework services for display in the rendered world view.</p>

  <h3>Property Restriction Error</h3>

  <p>Any property that has a restriction on it that does not contain a value passing the
  restriction will display the follow error, note the warning icon instead of the red border
  around the input box; hovering over the icon will display the error message.  Properties that
  have values violating any restriction on them will be saved to the file provided that the value
  does not have any formatting errors.</p>
