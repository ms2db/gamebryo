<h1>Navigating Around the World</h1>
    <p>Navigating the world in World Builder can be performed using the mouse or keyboard.  With an assortment of
    handy camera modes and different ways of warping around the world.</p>

     <h2>Keyboard Navigation</h2>
    
    <p>Keyboard navigation is consistent across any of the camera modes.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>[W] moves the camera forward.</li>
      <li>[A] moves the camera backward.</li>
      <li>[S] moves the camera left.</li>
      <li>[D] moves the camera right.</li>
      <li>[Shift] enters turbo mode, while the key is held down camera translations using the mouse 
      or keyboard will move at a faster rate.</li>
    </ul>
      
   <h2>Mouse Navigation</h2>
   <p>Mouse interaction changes within World Builder depending upon which Camera Mode 
    you are using.  Below are the standard camera mode controls.</p>
    
    <h3>Left Mouse Button</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[click] select / deselect an object.</li>
      <li>[click &amp; hold] rotate camera (look around the world).</li>
      <li>[+ Ctrl] multi-select (click again on other entities to add/remove them from the selection).</li>
      <li>[+ Alt] marquee-select (select a group of entities in one motion).</li>
      <li>[+ Shift] clone the selected entities using the Translate, Rotate, or Scale gizmo.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Right Mouse Button</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[click] context menu.</li>
      <li>[click &amp; hold] drive camera (move around the world).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Left + Right Mouse Button</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[click &amp; hold] elevator camera (moves the camera up and down and left and right).</li>
    </ul>
	<h3>Middle Mouse Button</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[click &amp; hold] pans the camera.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Scroll Wheel</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>[up] zoom in.</li>
      <li>[down] zoom out.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>To adjust the sensitivity and speed of these controls there are settings available in 
    Utilities > Settings > [User] > World Builder > Camera.</p>

    <h2>Camera Modes</h2>
    <p>
    The camera control modes and camera tools are bundled together and
        are found along with the other tool icons.</p>
        <div class="FigureContainer"><img src="images/wb_world_viewport_toolbar.jpg"/></div>
        <p>
    Camera modes are selected by toggling between 1 of the 3 camera navigation
        modes. Each has a different navigational affect on the viewport cameras when
    the mouse is used. Across
        all modes, the operation of the middle mouse wheel behaves the same. Scrolling
        the mouse wheel will move the camera forward and back along the depth axis.</p>
        
    <h3>Standard</h3>
    <p>When in standard mode (<img src="images/wb_world_viewport_standard.jpg" width="15" height="15" />), clicking the left mouse button and dragging will rotate
        the camera. This effectively gives the ability to look around the world.</p>
    <h3>Orbit</h3>
    <p>When in orbit mode (<img src="images/wb_world_viewport_orbit.jpg" width="15" height="15" />), if an entity is not selected, the orbit point will be determined by
        casting a ray from the center of the viewport into the scene. Whatever entity is
        hit first becomes the orbit point. If an entity is already selected or becomes
        selected, then that entity
        is used as the orbit point. The actual orbiting action is performed by clicking
        the left
        mouse button and dragging in the viewport.</p>
    <h3>Pan</h3>
    <p>When in Pan mode (<img src="images/wb_world_viewport_pan.jpg" width="15" height="15"/>), navigation occurs soley along the viewport plane. Click the
        left mouse
        button and dragging in the viewport will move the camera along one or both of
        the two axis depending on the direction of the drag. </p>
    <h2>Camera Tools</h2>
    <h3>Fly Level</h3>
    <p>When the &quot;Toggle Fly Level&quot; button (<img src="images/wb_world_viewport_fly.jpg" width="15" height="15" />) is pressed, the camera can be moved 
      using the WASD keys but will stay locked in the same horizontal plane. Press the icon again to turn this feature off.
    </p>
    <h3>Look At Selection</h3>
    <p>Pressing the &quot;Look At Selection&quot; button (<img src="images/wb_world_viewport_look.jpg" width="15" height="15" />) while having an entity selected will cause
        the camera to rotate toward the selected entity. The cameras translation,
        however, will be preserved.</p>
    <h3>Move to Selection</h3>
    <p>Pressing the &quot;Move to Selection&quot; button (<img src="images/wb_world_viewport_move.jpg" width="15" height="15" />) while having one or more entities selected will 
    perform a zoom to extents on the selection.</p>
    
    <h2>Miscellaneous Navigation</h2>
    <p>The user can also double click on an entity in the <a href="wb_ref_entity_view.htm">Entity View</a> to perform a "Move to Selection" on that entity.</p>
