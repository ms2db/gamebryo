<h1>Placing entities in the world</h1>

    <p>Entities can be placed in the world by simply dragging and dropping a placeable
        entity model from the <a href="wb_ref_palette_view.htm">Entity Palette</a>. Once an entity has been instantiated in the world, it can be manipulated using
        the various <a href="wb_entity_transformation_modes.htm">transformation gizmos</a>
        available in the tool.</p>
    <p>World Builder uses the concept of &quot;building block&quot; meshes in order to construct a
        scene. Typically, artists will model pieces of a structure in such a way that
        each piece can be reused throughout the level. The structural pieces are also
        modeled in such a way that each piece is a certain size and is meant to fit
        together with other pieces. Below is a screen shot of two different &quot;building
        block&quot; pieces. The first is a wall segment and the second is a corner piece.
        These pieces can then be chained together to form a room. Using a
        <a href="wb_world_grid.htm">consistent grid</a> while designing a scene is
        helpful for fitting pieces together.</p>
        <p><img src="images/wb_snap_wallsegment_2.png" />
    <p>In some cases, one may need to add many entities in the scene with a random
        rotation and scale applied to them. For example, when placing a lot of tree
        meshes or rock meshes across a landscape, it becomes a huge workflow bottleneck
        to select each tree or rock mesh and manually adjust the scale and rotation. 
        World Builder provides a tool called the
        <a href="wb_ref_randomizer_tool.htm">Randomizer</a> to assist with modifying the rotation
        and scale of multiple entities simultaneously.</p>
    <p>Finally, when a scene consists of many thousands of entities, it becomes
        difficult to focus in on specific areas.  Depending on the scene complexity,
        this many entities could also introduce tool time performance issues. Therefore, World Builder provides a
        means of <a href="wb_entity_visibility.htm">hiding entities and freezing
        entities</a>. Hiding entities allows the level designer to focus in on the
        area's he/she is interested in and freezing entities prevents accidental
        selection and manipulation of entities known to be in the final resting place in
        the scene.</p>
