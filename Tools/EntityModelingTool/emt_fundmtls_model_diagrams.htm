<h1>
Entity Model Diagrams
</h1>

<p>
Entity Model diagrams are a graphical representation of the relationships between the entity models and presets within a project. They are both powerful and flexible in that they help you set up and define these relationships allowing properties and behaviors to be shared and passed on from one entity model to another. Diagrams are particularly useful at the initial stages of production, when you are experimenting with the different mix-in possibilities. 
</p>

<p>
Diagrams are built within the Diagram Editor. Since you can have many items within a diagram, it is important that you be able to manage these items effectively. The Diagram Editor is very flexible and makes it easy for you to add, remove, rearrange, and link items within the diagram. Since you have a limited space within the Diagram Editor, you can also zoom in to focus on particular areas of the diagram or zoom out to view the diagram as a whole.

The following illustration demonstrates a typical example of a diagram.
