<h1>Preset Overview</h1>

<p>
After your game has been broken down into a series of models, you can begin to create derivatives of these models, which are called &quot;presets&quot;. A preset is basically an entity model with certain restrictions. The main difference between a preset and an entity model is that presets can&#39;t define new properties and behaviors, which means that they must inherit their properties and behaviors from an entity model. You can, however, override and modify the values of each inherited property to help distinguish one preset from another.
</p>

<p>
Presets are very useful when you have many similar entities within your game. You can create several presets and then link them all to the same parent entity model. For example, let&#39;s say all the vehicles in your game share the same types of properties and behaviors. In this case, you could create an entity model for &quot;Vehicle&quot;, define the common properties and behaviors, and then create presets for Honda Civic, Toyota Matrix, and Ford Mustang under the &quot;Vehicle&quot; entity model. The specific characteristics of each vehicle can be defined by modifying each preset&#39;s property values.
</p>

<p>
Instances of these presets are laid out within your game world using World Builder. Their properties can be tweaked and fine-tuned directly in World Builder to define their initial state within the game world.
