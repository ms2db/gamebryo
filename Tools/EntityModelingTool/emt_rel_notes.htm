<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Entity Model Editor and Preset Editor UI have been reworked for better performance and usability.
For example, the editing controls have more functional space, additional sorting and filtering options are available, and a tabbed layout has reduced the need for veritical scrolling.</li>
<li>New entity models and presets can now be created directly in the Mixin Editor using the context menu.
The new items will automatically mix in the active model or preset shown in the editor.</li>
<li>The redraw performance of the Mixin Editor has been greatly improved.</li>
<li>If a property is mixed in from a built-in model it will be noted as such in the .flat model
even if it is supplied at higher priority by a non-built-in mixin. The highest priority mixin will
still determine the traits and value of the property. Warnings will be output if a property is
supplied by multiple built-in models.</li>
<li>The Byte property type has been removed from EMT as it is not properly supported at run-time.</li>
<li>The PaletteHidden model trait has been added for entity models that can be instantiated, but that
should not be available in the World Builder Palette View. The Terrain entity model is an example.</li>
<li>The TimeOfDayAnimatable property trait has been added to support controlling properties via a
TimeOfDay entity.</li>
<li>The InWorldOnly behavior trait has been added for tagging behaviors that should only run while
the associated entity is in the world.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed a bug with virtual folders not correctly allowing additional folders to
    be added later.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
    <li>A new <a href="emt_ref_project_explorer.htm">EMT Project Explorer</a> view inside EMT
    provides for easier management of large EMT projects. This new view replaces the previous
    workflow via the Game Solution view. Models, presets, and diagrams can be organized into
    folders using multi-select. There is also a search engine for finding models and presets by
    partial name, mixin model, property, and behavior. Project contents can be viewed in details or
    thumbnails mode.</li>

    <li>EMT folders are now virtual folders rather than on-disk folders. This reduces the file
    management burden when reorganizing projects. Migration steps will add virtual folders for any
    existing on-disk folders.</li>

    <li>There are new EMT project settings for specifying on-disk subfolders to store new
    models/presets and diagrams.</li>

    <li>The display of Traits for Models, Behaviors, and Properties can be customized to be more
    easily understood by a studio. For more details, please see <a href=
    "../../Programmer/Toolbench/efr_extpoint_emt_friendlytrait.htm">Friendly Trait - Extension
    Point</a>.</li>

    <li>The Entity Modeling menu has new commands for generating .enum files for flat model,
    property, and behavior IDs. The output can be used to create Data Driven Enum (DDE) header
    files, which can improve runtime performance. See <a href=
    "../DataDrivenEnum/DataDrivenEnum_intro.htm">DDE Header Generator</a> for more
    information.</li>

    <li>On-load model updates to account for upstream changes are now described in the Output
    View.</li>

    <li>Mixin reordering can now be done by context menu commands in the Entity Model Editor. It is
    also still possible to drag mixins to a new position in the list.</li>

    <li>Deleted EMT projects are no longer restored on Save All.</li>

    <li>Open In Project commands now verify that the game solution includes the necessary
    project.</li>

    <li>The relevant EMT project name is displayed below the model name in model boxes when
    browsing into different EMT projects.</li>

    <li>Presets can now specify a preset as parent model.</li>

    <li>Fixed a problem accepting the Preset Factory dialog with no assets specified.</li>

    <li>Error reporting has been improved for loading corrupt data into EMT.</li>

    <li>There is a new command on the Entity Modeling menu for exporting all flat files for the
    entire game solution.</li>

    <li>The read-only, multi-select Preset Editor no longer allows changing the parent model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The Entity Modeling Tool is a new tool. See the <a href="emt_intro.htm">Entity Modeling
    Tool documentation</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>

<a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations" id="Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a><h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>

<h3>All Gamebryo LightSpeed Releases</h3>

<ul>
    <li>It is not possible in the tool to move models and presets between different projects, or to
    add existing model and preset files to a project. Refactoring of this nature must be
    accomplished by manual edits to the .emtproj XML file.</li>

    <li>When an entity model is renamed, any associated Lua behavior script will also be renamed.
    Python behavior scripts are not automatically updated in this way.</li>

    <li>Remember that exported flat models are needed by the game, but not by World Builder. This
    can make it easy to overlook them. By default, flat models are generated when EMT content is
    saved. If you have copied model libraries into a game solution, be sure that flat models are
    present before attempting to run the game.</li>

    <li>When a property is added to a parent model that already exists on a child, the child's
    property is converted to a mixin property. Be aware that if you later delete the mixin
    relationship, the original child property is lost.</li>

    <li>It is not recommended to make major edits to multiple open EMT projects that have a
    dependency. There is not a user-initiated synchronization process to apply changes in open
    projects to other dependent open projects as there is between EMT and World Builder. Instead,
    changes are generally applied as they are made. This can cause problems if, for example, mixin
    changes in a base EMT project silently invalidate operations in the undo buffer of a dependent
    EMT project. This could lead to a crash when attempting to undo changes in the dependent
    project. When making significant edits to a base EMT project, it is safer to have only that
    project open.</li>
</ul>
