<h1>Designing Entity Models for Clarity</h1>

<p>Often the designer of a model will not be same person tasked with editing presets and entities based on the model.  The Entity Modeling Tool provides several ways for a model designer to leave valuable hints for the users of the model data.</p>

<p>In the Entity Model Editor, new properties and behaviors are appended to the end of their respective lists when using the Add button.  However, the context menu allows inserting properties and behaviors at any point in the lists.  Furthermore, properties and behaviors can be reordered with drag and drop.  This ordering is then persisted for other users of the Entity Model Editor.  The same order is also used by entities that are instanced from the model definition, providing a familiar view in the World Builder Entity Editor.  Take advantage of the custom ordering to group properties and behaviors in logical sets that make the models easier to understand at a glance.</p>

<p>Models, properties, and behaviors can all be tagged with description text.  Use these fields to describe the design intent of the EMT data.  Property descriptions in particular are readily available during preset and entity editing.</p>

<p>In addition to the description field, model properties can be given special restrictions to limit the values that can be applied.  For example, a designer can require that a hit points property be set to a value between 0 and 100.  Or, an enumeration restriction could be applied to require that a string property must match 1 of 5 different text values.  Property restrictions can go a long way toward reducing user confusion in the tools and maintaining valid game data.</p>

<p>In large projects, models can become very complex.  To avoid clutter, consider using the Hidden trait on model properties.  This tool-time trait will hide a property on presets and entities.  It is appropriate for properties that will not vary per entity or that only change at runtime. The Summary property trait can also be specified to reduce clutter. It is used in conjunction with the Entity Editor filter options in World Builder.</p>
