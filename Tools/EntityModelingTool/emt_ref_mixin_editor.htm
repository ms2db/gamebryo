<h1>Mix-in Editor</h1>

<p>The Mix-in Editor is where you define the relationships between
the entity models and presets within your project. These
relationships define how properties and behaviors are inherited
from one entity model to another.</p>

<p>By managing the entity models and presets within a special
"mix-in" hierarchy, you can easily apply the same types of
properties and behaviors to similar entity models within your
game. Instead of applying the properties and behaviors to each
item, you can apply them to a top-level parent and have them
automatically applied to the entire branch of items below in the
hierarchy. You can also customize each child item by adding new
properties and behaviors or by overriding and modifying the ones
inherited from the parent.</p>

<p>The Mix-in Editor consists of a graphical workspace where you
can visualize and define parent/child relationships, called
mix-ins and reverse mix-ins, between the entity models and presets
in your project. You can "mix" models together by simply adding
them to the Mix-in Editor and creating relationships between them.
You can also modify property values directly in the Mix-in
Editor.</p>

<p>The Mix-in Editor is similar to the Diagram Editor in that it
gives you a strategic view of your projects. It is less flexible
than the Diagram Editor in that after a model has been added, it
can't be moved around. It does, however, benefit from being
auto-generated, which means it stays up to date as models are
added or modified. This makes it useful for navigating large or
frequently changing projects.</p>

<p>When you load an entity model or preset into the Mix-in Editor,
a tab is created with the name of the project in which the item
exists. The name of the loaded item appears in the title bar of
the view along with two navigation icons that allow you to switch
back and forth between previously loaded models and presets.</p>

                A graphical workspace where you can visualize and
                define mix-ins for the entity models in your
                project. Entities are "mixed" together to create
                parent/child relationships that define how
                properties and behaviors are inherited from one
                entity model to another.
