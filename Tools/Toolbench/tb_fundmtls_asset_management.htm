<h1>Asset Management Fundamentals</h1>

<p>Instead of directly storing file names and locations of
specific assets to be used at runtime, Gamebryo LightSpeed uses
an asset management system, implemented through the Asset Runtime
Service. While this is documented in detail elsewhere, there are
a few fundamentals of the system that are important for an
artist or designer to understand. Placing an asset file, such as
a nif, kf, or kfm file, somewhere inside your project's
Asset Web Root Directory will cause the Asset Runtime Service to
generate an Asset ID for that file. Toolbench, World Builder, and
your project can then use this Asset ID to refer to the asset,
instead of using the file name and location. This has several
benefits during development, but most importantly, Asset IDs are
the only way Gamebryo refers to asset files, so without one an
asset cannot be loaded into an application.</p>

<h2>Asset Management Benefits</h2>

<p>One of the major benefits of Asset IDs is that they allow an
asset to be rapidly iterated. By monitoring changes to the files
that are referenced by an Asset ID, the Asset Runtime Service can
detect when a change has been made and immediately re-load that
asset into Toolbench or even into a running game, giving
immediate, contextual feedback to incremental changes.</p>

<p>Asset IDs also allow the Asset Runtime Service to recognize
multiple files as variations of a single asset. This allows an
artist or designer to create various platform-optimized versions
of a single asset and have the correct versions of that asset be
used only on their respective platform.</p>

<h2>Asset IDs, Tags, and Metadata</h2>

<p>An Asset ID actually exists as a series of Tags that are
associated with your asset file. These Tags can contain various
kinds of metadata about your asset, such as what kind of asset it
is, what folder it is located in, what platform it is intended
for, and so on. These Tags are generated automatically by a
collection of .ini files in the asset-web-config folder in the
root of your project's Content Directory. All of the Tags and
Asset IDs for the entire project are then stored in a folder
called asset-web-metadata (which is also in your Content
Directory Root). Both the Automatic Tagging policies and Asset
Web Metadata will likely be maintained by a programmer, but it is
useful, as an artist or designer, to know where these files are
stored. It is possible that your local copy of the Asset Web
Metadata may become corrupted, in which case you can delete the
contents of the asset-web-metadata folder and regenerate you
Asset IDs afresh (by loading the associated Game Solution file
into Toolbench).</p>
