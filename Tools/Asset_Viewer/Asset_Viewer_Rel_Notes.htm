<a name="Added_Features_and_Fixed_Bugs"></a><h2>Added Features, Changed Behavior, and Fixed Bugs</h2>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.2</h3>

<ul>
  <li>None in this release.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added toggle buttons to the tool bar for several new debug visualization modes: nodes, hierarchy/bones, and bounding spheres.</li>
  <li>
      Added a message window which displays errors, warnings, and messages
      generated by NiRenderer and NiShaderFactory.  This allows shader parsing
      errors as well as messages related to the error shader to be viewed in
      AssetViewer.  The window will appear when the first error occurs, and can
      be enabled manually from the View menu.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo LightSpeed 3.0</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue in which Asset Viewer would not always register itself with the registry properly.</li>

    <li>Added the ability for Asset Viewer to select the up-axis.</li>

    <li>Removed the "Image subfolder" option from preferences.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.5.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Improved camera controls. The "Default" camera now can be moved when in picking mode. The camera simulates either 3D Studio MAX and Maya camera controls.</li>
  <li>Application now displays information relevant to NiMesh, including the contents of element arrays and mesh modifiers.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug where the collision lab could, while testing dynamic collisions, report bogus collisions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.3.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Application now displays parameters related to the Gamebryo Shadow system.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.1</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Application can now view texture only NIFs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.2.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Changed the name of the Gamebryo Scene Viewer to Asset Viewer.</li>
  <li>Asset Viewer's registry location has been changed to <span class="NDLSystemFont">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Emergent\Gamebryo Asset Viewer</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Gamebryo 2.0.0</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added an entry to the Asset Viewer Statistic View for a number of Gamebryo NiGeometry objects drawn per frame.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug in Asset Viewer where initially switching to a perspective camera would produce an incorrect aspect ratio.</li>
  <li>Improved implementation of dynamic collision detection for Asset Viewer's Collision Lab.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash bug that would occur in the Asset Viewer if Collision Lab mode was selected before having collision objects.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash bug that would occur in the Asset Viewer when viewing the NiTexturingProperty dialog when decal maps were present.</li>
  <li>Added shader map information to NiTexturingProperty dialog in Asset Viewer.</li>
  <li>Asset Viewer's registry has been changed from <span class="NDLSystemFont">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Numerical Design LTD\Gamebryo Scene Viewer</span> to <span class="NDLSystemFont">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\NDL\Gamebryo Scene Viewer</span>.</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem that caused the Overdraw mode to fail on certain graphics hardware.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where property windows were eventually tiling beyond the screen limits as they were opened.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where property windows were TOPMOST windows, causing them to still be on top when switching to another application.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash that was occurring when pressing Enter with nothing selected in the list view.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Known_Issues_and_Limitations"></a><h2>Known Issues and Limitations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>AssetViewer and other MFC-based applications have been observed to perform poorly when running on Vista. This appears to be an interaction between MFC and Vista that causes the application to be starved.</li>
  <li>When launching Asset Viewer, if a message box is displayed with the message "Renderer Creation Failed: Renderer creation failed. Please restart application.", this may be caused by the render window having a size of zero. To remedy this, adjust the sizes of the docking windows to ensure that the render window is visible. The render window is the part of the Asset Viewer window that is not a docking window. Once the render window has been made visible, you will need to restart the application in order for the renderer to be properly created.</li>
  <li>Keyboard commands for toolbar buttons only work if the render view has the keyboard focus. Click inside the render view to give it focus.</li>
  <li>In Asset Viewer, if a file containing lights at the highest level in the scene graph is added to the session, these lights are added to the "default node" that shares cameras, lights, etc. at the highest level. However, if that same file is subsequently removed, its light sources remain.</li>
  <li>Orthographic cameras may look skewed in Asset Viewer because the aspect ratio of the rendering window is not the same as the aspect ratio for which the orthographic camera was created.</li>
  <li>For some scenes in AssetViewer, the LOD buttons may only switch the NiSkinningLODController LOD once. AnimationTool can be used instead for these cases.</li>
</ul>
