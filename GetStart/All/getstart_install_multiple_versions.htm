<h1>Working with Multiple Versions of Gamebryo LightSpeed</h1>

<p>Gamebryo LightSpeed was not designed to have multiple working versions installed 
simultaneously.  However, the installer will allow you to install a new version of Gamebryo 
next to an existing Gamebryo installation. In doing so, it will affect the operation of the 
existing Gamebryo installation. Since users may wish to have multiple versions installed 
during the upgrade process between versions, the following information discusses how to work
with the associations and environment variables that are affected.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <em>EMERGENT_PATH</em> environment variable will point to the new installation, not 
    the old one. This will prevent art tools from finding shader files or shader libraries that 
    were in the existing installation. This will also cause problems rebuilding applications 
    and libraries in the existing installation, since the projects will look for include and lib
    files in the new installation rather than the existing one. Customers can re-define 
    <em>EMERGENT_PATH</em> to use the existing Gamebryo installation, but then the new 
    installation will no longer work.</li>
    <li>The .NIF, .KFM, and .GSL file extensions will be associated with art tools in the 
    new installation, not the existing one. Running an art tool from the existing installation
    (after redefining <em>EMERGENT_PATH</em>) will re-associate that art tool's respective file
    extension with the existing installation.</li>
    <li>Art tool exporters will be overwritten with the exporters from the new installation. The
    simplest way to work around this is to rebuild the exporter in the existing installation.
    The post-build steps will copy the exporters in place. Alternatively, run the installer for 
    the existing installation and select Repair for the art tools. As a third option, the 
    <A HREF="../../Art/Other/Updating_Artist_Tools.htm">Update Artist Tools</A> script will 
    deploy the tools from either the new or existing installation with minimal changes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Removing the existing installation</h2>

<p>After installing a new version of Gamebryo next to an older version, the easiest way to uninstall the existing version is simply to delete the files. If you attempt to run the uninstaller for the existing installation, it will break the new installation by removing the <em>EMERGENT_PATH</em> environment variable, file associations, exporter files, and other important features. Customers can repair the new installation by running the installer and selecting Repair.
