<h1>Information for Experienced Gamebryo Developers</h1>

<p>For an experienced Gamebryo developer, the suggested reading
list, at a minimum, is:</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="What_s_New_in_Gamebryo.htm">What's New in Gamebryo LightSpeed</a>:
    A brief discussion of the features that were added in this release.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "../../Convert/Previous/Converting_to_Gamebryo_3_0_Overview.htm">
    Converting to Gamebryo LightSpeed</a>: A mapping of class changes and
    behavior changes from previous versions of Gamebryo to the
    current release.</li>

    <li><a href=
    "../../RelNotes/Release_Notes_Introduction.htm">Release
    Notes</a>: All relevant release note documents, in particular
    those for the platforms being used.</li>

    <li>
        <a href=
        "../../Learn/FullDemos/Full_Demos_Introduction.htm">Game
        Demos</a>: Examples of both basic and advanced Gamebryo
        techniques:

        <ul>
            <li>
            <a href="../../Learn/MangledMetal/mm_intro.htm">MangledMetal</a>:
            The MangledMetal demo takes place in a world of giant steam-powered
            mechanical beings called Warjacks, from Privateer Press's table-top role-playing game,
            Warmachine&reg;. You control the actions of a mechanical being and are able to
            interact with the world via physical actions (using NVidia PhysX&trade;) and combat
            (moderated by Lua scripts). It is a full-featured, robust application demonstrating
            many of the features and best practices of the Emergent Game Framework.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Learn/FullDemos/MetalWars_Overview.htm">MetalWars</a>:
            MetalWars supplements the techniques demonstrated in
            MOUT with an array of advanced shader and animation
            blending techniques. Full source and artist files are
            included with both the samples. These samples can
            serve as excellent starting points for larger
            customer applications and games.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Learn/FullDemos/Lenguins_on_Ice_Overview.htm">Lenguins
            on Ice</a> (requires PhysX): This sample demonstrates
            PhysX by smashing little birds around with giant ice
            cubes. The demonstration is fully playable and also
            demonstrates several interesting Gamebryo shader
            techniques.</li>

            <li><a href=
            "../../Learn/FullDemos/Dodgeball_Overview.htm">DodgeBall</a>
            (requires PhysX): Demonstrates the use of physics
            rag-doll and blending in a light-hearted game
            environment. Also shows Gamebryo shadows.</li>
        </ul>
