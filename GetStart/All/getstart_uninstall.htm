<h1>Uninstalling Gamebryo LightSpeed</h1>

<p>On Windows XP, you can uninstall Gamebryo LightSpeed by using the Add or Remove Programs applet. On Windows Vista, you can uninstall LightSpeed via the Programs and Features control panel.</p>

<p>If you install LightSpeed for more than one platform, an entry for each platform is listed in Add or Remove Programs or the Programs and Features control panel. You need to uninstall each of these entries to completely uninstall LightSpeed. Partial uninstalls are not supported. If you have multiple platforms installed, and you then remove only one of those platforms, the remaining platforms will not function properly.</p>

<p>After uninstall, any files that were not initially installed by the
LightSpeed installer, including files that were created while building or
running LightSpeed libraries or applications, will remain on
disk. You will need to manually delete these file after you uninstall LightSpeed.</p>

<h2>Uninstallation Performance</h2>

<p>Because LightSpeed is a large installation with numerous
files, uninstallation can be a slow process. There are some steps
that you can take to improve the performance.</p>

<p>Before running the uninstaller, you can delete all of the files
in <em><span class="NDLSystemFont">%EMERGENT_PATH%</span></em>. This will substantially improve the uninstall performance, but it does have two drawbacks.</p>

<ul>
    <li>The DLL that is responsible for displaying thumbnail
    icons for .NIF files will not be properly unregistered during
    uninstall. You can avoid this by typing the following
    from the command line <em>before</em> you run the uninstall:

        <p class="indent1"><span>regsvr32 /u
        <em>%EMERGENT_PATH%</em>\SDK\Win32\DLL\NiThumbnailExtractor32VC80S.dll</span></p>
    </li>

    <li>The <a href="../../Art/Maya/MelMunger.htm">Maya Mel
    Munger</a> will not be run, and so the Gamebryo Tools Shelf
    will continue to appear in Maya even though none of the
    buttons will function.</li>
</ul>

<p>The sequence in which you uninstall the entries for the platforms does not matter, but the uninstall will run more quickly if you uninstall in the opposite order in which you install.</p>
