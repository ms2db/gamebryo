<h1>Multiplayer Rapid Iteration: Tutorial Overview</h1>

<p>This tutorial explains how you can perform rapid iteration workflows on a multiplayer game. It
uses the Peer Game sample application to demonstrate this functionality.</p>

<p>Rapid iteration of a multiplayer game works very similarly to rapidly iterating multiple
instances of a single-player game (for example, on multiple consoles all connected to the same
Toolbench). All of the running instances of the game are updated as you make changes in your tool.
However, with a multiplayer game, you also have to consider the effects of entity replication.</p>

<p>With a multiplayer game, there are differences between a host and a peer in terms of which
entities get loaded on which processes. For example, the Peer Game world is implemented in
Toolbench using a single block file named <span class="NDLSystemFont">PeerGame.block</span>. This
uses Toolbench's layering capabilities to generate two separate exported blocks, one from each
layer. All clients load the <span class="NDLSystemFont">PeerGame.xblock</span> file, but only a
single designated host loads the <span class="NDLSystemFont">PeerGame_HostOnly.xblock</span> file.
So, one source data file generates two block files that are loaded differently by each process. In
turn, this also affects whether a given behavior runs on a Host or Peer instance; the behavior will
run in whatever process owns the original entity. As a result, some changes that you make to assets
may only result in a reload by some of the running game instances, depending on their role, and
some changes may result in replication of entity properties between host and peer, and not a direct
reload of whatever you changed by the peer. You should keep these facts in mind as you rapidly
iterate on multiplayer games.</p>
