<h1>Base Game: Introduction</h1>

<p>Base Game is an application that demonstrates Foundation and Game Framework functionality in a simple game situation. It extends the Hello World sample by adding some basic
game play elements and addition system services such as physics support and camera control.
Base Game allows the player to move an avatar around a multi-room layout, solving puzzles and
interacting with game Entities.</p>

<p>In this section, we include a tutorial that walks you through through the process of extending Hello World to create Base Game. In the process, the various parts of the Base Game
application are described along with a discussion of why these pieces are used and how they fit
into the Game Framework. We also include a description of the Base Game demo itself, including an overview of how it works, its controls, and its principal source, script, and configuration files.</p>
